2511.14761,ARC Is a Vision Problem!,"The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the problem from a vision-centric perspective. In this work, we formulate ARC within a vision paradigm, framing it as an image-to-image translation problem. To incorporate visual priors, we represent the inputs on a ""canvas"" that can be processed like natural images. It is then natural for us to apply standard vision architectures, such as a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), to perform image-to-image mapping. Our model is trained from scratch solely on ARC data and generalizes to unseen tasks through test-time training. Our framework, termed Vision ARC (VARC), achieves 60.4% accuracy on the ARC-1 benchmark, substantially outperforming existing methods that are also trained from scratch. Our results are competitive with those of leading LLMs and close the gap to average human performance.",ARC 旨在推动抽象推理研究，现有方法多为语言导向（如 LLM），但 ARC 任务本质视觉却少视觉中心方案。本文将 ARC 归为视觉范式下的图到图翻译，以 “画布” 处理输入，用 ViT，仅靠 ARC 数据从零训练，借测试时训练泛化。框架 VARC 在 ARC-1 准确率 60.4%，超同类从零训方法，比肩顶尖 LLM，接近人类平均水平。
2511.14730,Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for Power Distribution System Restoration,"Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficult to scale. This paper applies a Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) framework, instantiated through Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO), to enable coordinated restoration across interconnected microgrids. Each agent controls a distinct microgrid with different loads, DER capacities, and switch counts, introducing practical structural heterogeneity. Decentralized actor policies are trained with a centralized critic to compute advantage values for stable on-policy updates. A physics-informed OpenDSS environment provides full power flow feedback and enforces operational limits via differentiable penalty signals rather than invalid action masking. The total DER generation is capped at 2400 kW, and each microgrid must satisfy local supply-demand feasibility. Experiments on the IEEE 123-bus and IEEE 8500-node systems show that HAPPO achieves faster convergence, higher restored power, and smoother multi-seed training than DQN, PPO, MAES, MAGDPG, MADQN, Mean-Field RL, and QMIX. Results demonstrate that incorporating microgrid-level heterogeneity within the HARL framework yields a scalable, stable, and constraint-aware solution for complex PDS restoration.",针对大规模停电后的配电系统恢复需协调分布式能源且面临非线性约束的难题，本文采用异构代理强化学习框架，通过 HAPPO 实现互联微电网的协调恢复。针对微电网负载、容量和开关数量的结构异构性，训练去中心化 Actor 和中心化 Critic 以计算优势值。利用物理感知的 OpenDSS 环境提供潮流反馈，并通过可微惩罚信号而非无效动作掩码来强制执行操作限制。在 IEEE 123 节点和 8500 节点系统上的实验表明，HAPPO 在收敛速度、恢复功率和稳定性方面优于 DQN、QMIX 及 PPO 等基线，证明了异构感知在复杂 PDS 恢复中的有效性。
2511.14728,Automated proving in planar geometry based on the complex number identity method and elimination,"We improve the complex number identity proving method to a fully automated procedure, based on elimination ideals. By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role that if $r_1,r_2,\ldots$ are real, $r$ must also be real if there is a linear polynomial $p(r)\in I$, unless division by zero occurs when expressing $r$. Our results are presented in Mathematica, Maple and in a new version of the Giac computer algebra system. Finally, we present a prototype of the automated procedure in an experimental version of the dynamic geometry software GeoGebra.",本文改进复数恒等式证明方法，基于消去理想实现平面几何的全自动证明。通过将实关系假设重写为代数方程，清除分母并引入松弛变量，消除了所有自由和关系点变量。若在生成的理想 $I$ 中存在线性多项式 $p(r)$，且除数不为零，则可得出结论。该方法已在 Mathematica、Maple 和新版 Giac 代数系统中实现，并在 GeoGebra 实验版中展示了自动化原型，提升了动态几何软件的证明能力。
2511.14719,Zero-shot Synthetic Video Realism Enhancement via Structure-aware Denoising,"We propose an approach to enhancing synthetic video realism, which can re-render synthetic videos from a simulator in photorealistic fashion. Our realism enhancement approach is a zero-shot framework that focuses on preserving the multi-level structures from synthetic videos into the enhanced one in both spatial and temporal domains, built upon a diffusion video foundational model without further fine-tuning. Specifically, we incorporate an effective modification to have the generation/denoising process conditioned on estimated structure-aware information from the synthetic video, such as depth maps, semantic maps, and edge maps, by an auxiliary model, rather than extracting the information from a simulator. This guidance ensures that the enhanced videos are consistent with the original synthetic video at both the structural and semantic levels. Our approach is a simple yet general and powerful approach to enhancing synthetic video realism: we show that our approach outperforms existing baselines in structural consistency with the original video while maintaining state-of-the-art photorealism quality in our experiments.",针对合成视频真实感增强，提出一种基于扩散视频基础模型的零样本框架，无需微调即可将合成视频重渲染为照片级逼真风格。方法核心在于结构感知去噪，利用辅助模型估计的深度图、语义图和边缘图作为条件引导生成过程，而非依赖模拟器信息。这种引导确保了增强视频在空间和时间域上与原始视频的结构及语义一致性。实验表明，该方法在保持 SOTA 级真实感质量的同时，在结构一致性上优于现有基线。
2511.14715,\textit{FLARE}: Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Reputation for Robust Client Reliability in Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deployments. We propose FLARE, an adaptive reputation-based framework that transforms client reliability assessment from binary decisions to a continuous, multi-dimensional trust evaluation. FLARE integrates: (i) a multi-dimensional reputation score capturing performance consistency, statistical anomaly indicators, and temporal behavior, (ii) a self-calibrating adaptive threshold mechanism that adjusts security strictness based on model convergence and recent attack intensity, (iii) reputation-weighted aggregation with soft exclusion to proportionally limit suspicious contributions rather than eliminating clients outright, and (iv) a Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanism enabling reputation scoring on privatized client updates. We further introduce a highly evasive Statistical Mimicry (SM) attack, a benchmark adversary that blends honest gradients with synthetic perturbations and persistent drift to remain undetected by traditional filters. Extensive experiments with 100 clients on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that FLARE maintains high model accuracy and converges faster than state-of-the-art Byzantine-robust methods under diverse attack types, including label flipping, gradient scaling, adaptive attacks, ALIE, and SM. FLARE improves robustness by up to 16% and preserves model convergence within 30% of the non-attacked baseline, while achieving strong malicious-client detection performance with minimal computational overhead. https://github.com/Anonymous0-0paper/FLARE",针对联邦学习中恶意客户端的拜占庭攻击和数据投毒，提出了 FLARE 框架，将客户端可靠性评估从二元决策转变为连续多维信任评估。FLARE 整合了性能一致性、统计异常和时间行为，采用自校准自适应阈值调整安全严格度，并通过声誉加权聚合与软排除限制可疑贡献，辅以本地差分隐私机制。针对新引入的高隐蔽性统计模仿（SM）攻击及传统攻击，在 MNIST 和 CIFAR-10 等数据集上的实验显示，FLARE 将鲁棒性提升高达 16%，在保持模型收敛性的同时实现了低开销的恶意检测。
2511.14702,Seeing Beyond the Image: ECG and Anatomical Knowledge-Guided Myocardial Scar Segmentation from Late Gadolinium-Enhanced Images,"Accurate segmentation of myocardial scar from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) cardiac MRI is essential for evaluating tissue viability, yet remains challenging due to variable contrast and imaging artifacts. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals provide complementary physiological information, as conduction abnormalities can help localize or suggest scarred myocardial regions. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates ECG-derived electrophysiological information with anatomical priors from the AHA-17 atlas for physiologically consistent LGE-based scar segmentation. As ECGs and LGE-MRIs are not acquired simultaneously, we introduce a Temporal Aware Feature Fusion (TAFF) mechanism that dynamically weights and fuses features based on their acquisition time difference. Our method was evaluated on a clinical dataset and achieved substantial gains over the state-of-the-art image-only baseline (nnU-Net), increasing the average Dice score for scars from 0.6149 to 0.8463 and achieving high performance in both precision (0.9115) and sensitivity (0.9043). These results show that integrating physiological and anatomical knowledge allows the model to ""see beyond the image"", setting a new direction for robust and physiologically grounded cardiac scar segmentation.",晚期钆增强（LGE）心脏 MRI 的心肌瘢痕分割受限于成像伪影，本文提出融合 ECG 电生理信息与 AHA-17 图谱解剖先验的多模态框架。针对 ECG 与 MRI 非同步采集的问题，设计了时间感知特征融合（TAFF）机制，根据采集时间差动态加权融合特征。在临床数据集上，该方法将瘢痕分割的 Dice 分数从 nnU-Net 的 0.6149 提升至 0.8463，显著提高了精度与灵敏度，证明了整合生理与解剖知识能有效辅助模型“超越图像”进行诊断。
2511.14694,Near-Lossless Model Compression Enables Longer Context Inference in DNA Large Language Models,"Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental ""grammar"" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key-value (KV) caches during autoregressive decoding. These constraints force the use of heuristics such as fixed-window truncation or sliding windows, which compromise fidelity on ultra-long sequences by discarding distant information. We introduce FOCUS (Feature-Oriented Compression for Ultra-long Self-attention), a progressive context-compression module that can be plugged into pretrained DNA LLMs. FOCUS combines the established k-mer representation in genomics with learnable hierarchical compression: it inserts summary tokens at k-mer granularity and progressively compresses attention key and value activations across multiple Transformer layers, retaining only the summary KV states across windows while discarding ordinary-token KV. A shared-boundary windowing scheme yields a stationary cross-window interface that propagates long-range information with minimal loss. We validate FOCUS on an Evo-2-based DNA LLM fine-tuned on GRCh38 chromosome 1 with self-supervised training and randomized compression schedules to promote robustness across compression ratios. On held-out human chromosomes, FOCUS achieves near-lossless fidelity: compressing a 1 kb context into only 10 summary tokens (about 100x) shifts the average per-nucleotide probability by only about 0.0004. Compared to a baseline without compression, FOCUS reduces KV-cache memory and converts effective inference scaling from O(N^2) to near-linear O(N), enabling about 100x longer inference windows on commodity GPUs with near-lossless fidelity.",针对 DNA 大语言模型在处理超长序列时面临的注意力计算和 KV 缓存瓶颈，提出了 FOCUS 渐进式上下文压缩模块。该方法结合 k-mer 表示与可学习的分层压缩，在 k-mer 粒度插入摘要 token，逐步压缩多层注意力 KV 激活，仅保留摘要 KV 状态。配合共享边界窗口机制传播长程信息，将推理复杂度从 $O(N^2)$ 降至近线性 $O(N)$。在 Evo-2 模型上的验证表明，FOCUS 可将 1kb 上下文压缩为 10 个 token（100倍），预测概率偏移仅 0.0004，在消费级 GPU 上实现了近乎无损的 100 倍长窗口推理。
2511.14691,Attention via Synaptic Plasticity is All You Need: A Biologically Inspired Spiking Neuromorphic Transformer,"Attention is the brain's ability to selectively focus on a few specific aspects while ignoring irrelevant ones. This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural circuits, Transformer attention relies on dot-product similarity to weight elements in the input sequence. Neuromorphic computing, especially spiking neural networks (SNNs), offers a brain-inspired path to energy-efficient intelligence. Despite recent work on attention-based spiking Transformers, the core attention layer remains non-neuromorphic. Current spiking attention (i) relies on dot-product or element-wise similarity suited to floating-point operations, not event-driven spikes; (ii) keeps attention matrices that suffer from the von Neumann bottleneck, limiting in-memory computing; and (iii) still diverges from brain-like computation. To address these issues, we propose the Spiking STDP Transformer (S$^{2}$TDPT), a neuromorphic Transformer that implements self-attention through spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), embedding query--key correlations in synaptic weights. STDP, a core mechanism of memory and learning in the brain and widely studied in neuromorphic devices, naturally enables in-memory computing and supports non-von Neumann hardware. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, our model achieves 94.35\% and 78.08\% accuracy with only four timesteps and 0.49 mJ on CIFAR-100, an 88.47\% energy reduction compared to a standard ANN Transformer. Grad-CAM shows that the model attends to semantically relevant regions, enhancing interpretability. Overall, S$^{2}$TDPT illustrates how biologically inspired attention can yield energy-efficient, hardware-friendly, and explainable neuromorphic models.",针对 Transformer 高能耗及传统脉冲注意力仍依赖浮点运算的问题，提出了基于脉冲时序依赖可塑性（STDP）的神经形态 Transformer（$S^{2}$TDPT）。该模型通过 STDP 机制实现自注意力，将 Query-Key 相关性嵌入突触权重，天然支持存内计算并突破冯·诺依曼瓶颈。在 CIFAR-10/100 上，仅需 4 个时间步即可分别达到 94.35% 和 78.08% 的准确率，能耗低至 0.49 mJ，较标准 ANN 减少 88.47%。Grad-CAM 可视化证实了其语义聚焦能力，实现了高效、硬件友好且可解释的神经形态计算。
2511.14689,Impact of Image Resolution on Age Estimation with DeepFace and InsightFace,"Automatic age estimation is widely used for age verification, where input images often vary considerably in resolution. This study evaluates the effect of image resolution on age estimation accuracy using DeepFace and InsightFace. A total of 1000 images from the IMDB-Clean dataset were processed in seven resolutions, resulting in 7000 test samples. Performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Standard Deviation (SD), and Median Absolute Error (MedAE). Based on this study, we conclude that input image resolution has a clear and consistent impact on the accuracy of age estimation in both DeepFace and InsightFace. Both frameworks achieve optimal performance at 224x224 pixels, with an MAE of 10.83 years (DeepFace) and 7.46 years (InsightFace). At low resolutions, MAE increases substantially, while very high resolutions also degrade accuracy. InsightFace is consistently faster than DeepFace across all resolutions.",针对自动年龄估计中输入图像分辨率对准确性的影响，本研究基于 IMDB-Clean 数据集，评估了 DeepFace 和 InsightFace 在七种不同分辨率下的表现。实验发现分辨率对准确性有显著的非线性影响，两种框架均在 224x224 像素时达到最佳性能，MAE 分别为 10.83 年和 7.46 年。过低分辨率会导致误差大幅增加，而过高分辨率亦会降低精度。对比显示，InsightFace 在所有分辨率下均比 DeepFace 处理速度更快且误差更小。
2511.14688,Ground Truth Generation for Multilingual Historical NLP using LLMs,"Historical and low-resource NLP remains challenging due to limited annotated data and domain mismatches with modern, web-sourced corpora. This paper outlines our work in using large language models (LLMs) to create ground-truth annotations for historical French (16th-20th centuries) and Chinese (1900-1950) texts. By leveraging LLM-generated ground truth on a subset of our corpus, we were able to fine-tune spaCy to achieve significant gains on period-specific tests for part-of-speech (POS) annotations, lemmatization, and named entity recognition (NER). Our results underscore the importance of domain-specific models and demonstrate that even relatively limited amounts of synthetic data can improve NLP tools for under-resourced corpora in computational humanities research.",针对历史文本（如 16-20 世纪法语和 1900-1950 中文）因缺乏标注数据和领域不匹配导致的 NLP 处理难题，本文利用大语言模型（LLM）生成高质量的标注作为基准真值。通过利用这些合成数据对 spaCy 进行微调，模型在特定历史时期的词性标注（POS）、词形还原和命名实体识别（NER）任务上取得了显著性能提升。结果表明，即使是有限的领域特定合成数据，也能有效改善计算人文学科中低资源语料库的 NLP 工具性能。
2511.14670,SkillGen: Learning Domain Skills for In-Context Sequential Decision Making,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to sequential decision-making through in-context learning (ICL), yet their effectiveness is highly sensitive to prompt quality. Effective prompts should meet three principles: focus on decision-critical information, provide step-level granularity, and minimize reliance on expert annotations through label efficiency. However, existing ICL methods often fail to satisfy all three criteria simultaneously. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce SkillGen, a skill-based ICL framework for structured sequential reasoning. It constructs an action-centric, domain-level graph from sampled trajectories, identifies high-utility actions via temporal-difference credit assignment, and retrieves step-wise skills to generate fine-grained, context-aware prompts. We further present a theoretical analysis showing that focusing on high-utility segments supports task identifiability and informs more effective ICL prompt design. Experiments on ALFWorld, BabyAI, and ScienceWorld, using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, show that SkillGen achieves consistent gains, improving progress rate by 5.9%-16.5% on average across models.",针对大语言模型在序列决策中对提示质量敏感的问题，提出了基于技能的上下文学习框架 SkillGen。该方法从采样轨迹构建动作中心的领域图，利用时序差分信用分配识别高效用动作，并检索逐步技能以生成细粒度的上下文感知提示。理论分析表明，聚焦高效用片段能增强任务可识别性。在 ALFWorld、BabyAI 和 ScienceWorld 上的实验显示，SkillGen 使不同 LLM 的任务进度率平均提升了 5.9% 至 16.5%，有效平衡了提示的关键性、粒度和标注效率。
2511.14659,NORA-1.5: A Vision-Language-Action Model Trained using World Model- and Action-based Preference Rewards,"Vision--language--action (VLA) models have recently shown promising performance on a variety of embodied tasks, yet they still fall short in reliability and generalization, especially when deployed across different embodiments or real-world environments. In this work, we introduce NORA-1.5, a VLA model built from the pre-trained NORA backbone by adding to it a flow-matching-based action expert. This architectural enhancement alone yields substantial performance gains, enabling NORA-1.5 to outperform NORA and several state-of-the-art VLA models across both simulated and real-world benchmarks. To further improve robustness and task success, we develop a set of reward models for post-training VLA policies. Our rewards combine (i) an action-conditioned world model (WM) that evaluates whether generated actions lead toward the desired goal, and (ii) a deviation-from-ground-truth heuristic that distinguishes good actions from poor ones. Using these reward signals, we construct preference datasets and adapt NORA-1.5 to target embodiments through direct preference optimization (DPO). Extensive evaluations show that reward-driven post-training consistently improves performance in both simulation and real-robot settings, demonstrating significant VLA model-reliability gains through simple yet effective reward models. Our findings highlight NORA-1.5 and reward-guided post-training as a viable path toward more dependable embodied agents suitable for real-world deployment.",针对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在真实部署中的可靠性不足，提出了 NORA-1.5。该模型在 NORA 骨干上增加了基于流匹配（flow-matching）的动作专家，大幅提升了性能。为增强鲁棒性，开发了结合动作条件世界模型（WM）和真值偏差启发式的奖励模型，用于构建偏好数据集。通过直接偏好优化（DPO）将 NORA-1.5 适配至目标具身环境。仿真和真机实验表明，这种基于奖励的后训练策略显著提高了 VLA 策略的任务成功率和可靠性。
2511.14654,Improving segmentation of retinal arteries and veins using cardiac signal in doppler holograms,"Doppler holography is an emerging retinal imaging technique that captures the dynamic behavior of blood flow with high temporal resolution, enabling quantitative assessment of retinal hemodynamics. This requires accurate segmentation of retinal arteries and veins, but traditional segmentation methods focus solely on spatial information and overlook the temporal richness of holographic data. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for artery-vein segmentation in temporal Doppler holograms using standard segmentation architectures. By incorporating features derived from a dedicated pulse analysis pipeline, our method allows conventional U-Nets to exploit temporal dynamics and achieve performance comparable to more complex attention- or iteration-based models. These findings demonstrate that time-resolved preprocessing can unlock the full potential of deep learning for Doppler holography, opening new perspectives for quantitative exploration of retinal hemodynamics. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/DigitalHolography/",多普勒全息术能以高时间分辨率捕捉视网膜血流动态，但现有动静脉分割方法往往忽略其时间信息。本文提出一种利用心脏信号的时间分辨预处理方法，通过专门的脉搏分析管道提取特征，使标准的 U-Net 分割架构能够利用全息数据的血流动力学信息。实验表明，该方法无需复杂的注意力机制或迭代模型，即可实现与先进模型相当的分割性能，证明了时间分辨预处理在视网膜血流动力学定量探索中的潜力。
2511.14650,AutoTool: Efficient Tool Selection for Large Language Model Agents,"Large Language Model (LLM) agents have emerged as powerful tools for automating complex tasks by leveraging the reasoning and decision-making abilities of LLMs. However, a major bottleneck in current agent frameworks lies in the high inference cost of tool selection, especially in approaches like ReAct that repeatedly invoke the LLM to determine which tool to use at each step. In this work, we propose AutoTool, a novel graph-based framework that bypasses repeated LLM inference by exploiting a key empirical observation: tool usage inertia - the tendency of tool invocations to follow predictable sequential patterns. AutoTool constructs a directed graph from historical agent trajectories, where nodes represent tools and edges capture transition probabilities, effectively modeling the inertia in tool selection. It further integrates parameter-level information to refine tool input generation. By traversing this structured representation, AutoTool efficiently selects tools and their parameters with minimal reliance on LLM inference. Extensive experiments across diverse agent tasks demonstrate that AutoTool reduces inference costs by up to 30% while maintaining competitive task completion rates, offering a practical and scalable enhancement for inference-heavy frameworks. Our work highlights the promise of integrating statistical structure into LLM agent design for greater efficiency without sacrificing performance.",针对 LLM 智能体（如 ReAct）在工具选择步骤频繁调用模型导致的高推理成本问题，利用工具调用的惯性特征，提出了基于图的 AutoTool 框架。该方法从历史轨迹构建有向图，以节点表示工具，边表示转移概率，并整合参数级信息。通过遍历该结构化表示，AutoTool 能在极少依赖 LLM 推理的情况下高效预测工具及其参数。实验显示，该方法在保持任务完成率的同时降低了高达 30% 的推理成本，为计算密集型框架提供了高效的扩展方案。
2511.14632,Adapformer: Adaptive Channel Management for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,"In multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), accurately modeling the intricate dependencies among multiple variables remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional approaches. Most existing models adopt either \textbf{channel-independent} (CI) or \textbf{channel-dependent} (CD) strategies, each presenting distinct drawbacks. CI methods fail to leverage the potential insights from inter-channel interactions, resulting in models that may not fully exploit the underlying statistical dependencies present in the data. Conversely, CD approaches often incorporate too much extraneous information, risking model overfitting and predictive inefficiency. To address these issues, we introduce the Adaptive Forecasting Transformer (\textbf{Adapformer}), an advanced Transformer-based framework that merges the benefits of CI and CD methodologies through effective channel management. The core of Adapformer lies in its dual-stage encoder-decoder architecture, which includes the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{E}nhancer (\textbf{ACE}) for enriching embedding processes and the \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{C}hannel \textbf{F}orecaster (\textbf{ACF}) for refining the predictions. ACE enhances token representations by selectively incorporating essential dependencies, while ACF streamlines the decoding process by focusing on the most relevant covariates, substantially reducing noise and redundancy. Our rigorous testing on diverse datasets shows that Adapformer achieves superior performance over existing models, enhancing both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, thus making it state-of-the-art in MTSF.",针对多元时间序列预测（MTSF）中通道独立（CI）策略忽略交互和通道依赖（CD）策略易过拟合的问题，提出了 Adapformer 框架。该模型采用双阶段编码器-解码器架构实现自适应通道管理：自适应通道增强器（ACE）选择性地整合关键依赖以丰富 Token 表示，自适应通道预测器（ACF）则在解码过程中聚焦相关协变量以减少噪声。在多个数据集上的测试表明，Adapformer 有效结合了 CI 和 CD 的优势，在预测精度和计算效率上均优于现有 SOTA 模型。
2511.14631,Enhancing Agentic Autonomous Scientific Discovery with Vision-Language Model Capabilities,"We show that multi-agent systems guided by vision-language models (VLMs) improve end-to-end autonomous scientific discovery. By treating plots as verifiable checkpoints, a VLM-as-a-judge evaluates figures against dynamically generated domain-specific rubrics, enabling agents to correct their own errors and steer exploratory data analysis in real-time. Case studies in cosmology and astrochemistry demonstrate recovery from faulty reasoning paths and adaptation to new datasets without human intervention. On a 10-task benchmark for data-driven discovery, VLM-augmented systems achieve pass at 1 scores of 0.7-0.8, compared to 0.2-0.3 for code-only and 0.4-0.5 for code-and-text baselines, while also providing auditable reasoning traces that improve interpretability. Code available here: https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent",本文展示了由视觉语言模型（VLM）引导的多智能体系统在端到端自主科学发现中的应用。通过将绘图视为可验证的检查点，利用“VLM 即裁判”针对动态生成的量规评估图表，使智能体能实时纠错并引导探索性数据分析。在宇宙学和天体化学的案例研究中，系统成功从错误推理中恢复并适应新数据集。在包含 10 项任务的基准测试中，VLM 增强系统的 pass@1 得分达到 0.7-0.8，显著优于仅代码基线的 0.2-0.3，并提供了可审计的推理轨迹。
2511.14630,Failure to Mix: Large language models struggle to answer according to desired probability distributions,"Scientific idea generation and selection requires exploration following a target probability distribution. In contrast, current AI benchmarks have objectively correct answers, and training large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning against these benchmarks discourages probabilistic exploration. Here, we conducted systematic experiments requesting LLMs to produce outputs following simple probabilistic distributions, and found that all modern LLMs tested grossly fail to follow the distributions. For example, requesting a binary output of ""1"" 49% of the time produces an answer of ""0"" nearly 100% of the time. This step function-like behavior of near-exclusively generating the output with marginally highest probability even overrules even strong in-built LLM biases.",科学创意生成需要遵循目标概率分布进行探索，但现代大语言模型（LLM）因基于强化学习对齐客观正确答案，抑制了这种概率探索能力。系统实验表明，当要求 LLM 按简单概率分布（如 49% 的概率输出“1”）生成输出时，所有测试模型均彻底失败，表现出阶跃函数般的行为：几乎以 100% 的频率生成概率略高的选项（如“0”）。这种倾向于生成最高概率输出的机制甚至覆盖了模型内置的强烈偏见，揭示了 LLM 在需要混合策略任务中的根本局限。
2511.14624,Active Matter as a framework for living systems-inspired Robophysics,"Robophysics investigates the physical principles that govern living-like robots operating in complex, realworld environments. Despite remarkable technological advances, robots continue to face fundamental efficiency limitations. At the level of individual units, locomotion remains a challenge, while at the collective level, robot swarms struggle to achieve shared purpose, coordination, communication, and cost efficiency. This perspective article examines the key challenges faced by bio-inspired robotic collectives and highlights recent research efforts that incorporate principles from active-matter physics and biology into the modeling and design of robot swarms.",机器人物理学致力于研究现实环境中仿生机器人的物理原理。尽管技术进步显著，个体运动和群体协作（如共识、通信、成本效率）仍面临瓶颈。本文提出将“活性物质（Active Matter）”物理学作为理解和设计仿生机器人集群的框架。通过回顾近期研究，文章探讨了如何将活性物质物理和生物学原理融入机器人群体的建模与设计中，以解决群体协调和效率限制，为构建具备生命特征的高效机器人集群提供了新的物理视角。
2511.14619,Expert-Guided POMDP Learning for Data-Efficient Modeling in Healthcare,"Learning the parameters of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) from limited data is a significant challenge. We introduce the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm, a novel approach that incorporates expert knowledge into the parameter estimation process by enriching the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework with fuzzy pseudo-counts derived from an expert-defined fuzzy model. This integration naturally reformulates the problem as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation, effectively guiding learning in environments with limited data. In synthetic medical simulations, our method consistently outperforms the standard EM algorithm under both low-data and high-noise conditions. Furthermore, a case study on Myasthenia Gravis illustrates the ability of the Fuzzy MAP EM algorithm to recover a clinically coherent POMDP, demonstrating its potential as a practical tool for data-efficient modeling in healthcare.",在数据受限的医疗场景下学习部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程（POMDP）参数极具挑战。本文提出 Fuzzy MAP EM 算法，通过引入专家定义的模糊模型生成的模糊伪计数，丰富了期望最大化（EM）框架，将问题重构为最大后验概率（MAP）估计。在低数据和高噪声的合成模拟中，该方法优于标准 EM。重症肌无力案例研究表明，Fuzzy MAP EM 能恢复临床连贯的 POMDP 模型，证明了其在结合专家知识与数据高效建模方面的实用价值。
2511.14603,A Method for Characterizing Disease Progression from Acute Kidney Injury to Chronic Kidney Disease,"Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention.",为识别急性肾损伤（AKI）进展为慢性肾病（CKD）的高危患者，本研究利用电子健康记录（EHR）数据动态追踪临床演变。通过聚类纵向医疗代码和肌酐测量值生成的患者向量，识别出 15 种急性后临床状态，并利用多状态建模估算状态转移概率。研究涵盖 20,699 名患者，其中 17% 发展为 CKD。生存分析揭示了不同状态下新旧风险因素（如糖尿病、肝病）的差异化影响。该数据驱动方法有助于开发早期 CKD 检测的决策支持工具。
2511.14601,MRI Embeddings Complement Clinical Predictors for Cognitive Decline Modeling in Alzheimer's Disease Cohorts,"Accurate modeling of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease is essential for early stratification and personalized management. While tabular predictors provide robust markers of global risk, their ability to capture subtle brain changes remains limited. In this study, we evaluate the predictive contributions of tabular and imaging-based representations, with a focus on transformer-derived Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) embeddings. We introduce a trajectory-aware labeling strategy based on Dynamic Time Warping clustering to capture heterogeneous patterns of cognitive change, and train a 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) via unsupervised reconstruction on harmonized and augmented MRI data to obtain anatomy-preserving embeddings without progression labels. The pretrained encoder embeddings are subsequently assessed using both traditional machine learning classifiers and deep learning heads, and compared against tabular representations and convolutional network baselines. Results highlight complementary strengths across modalities. Clinical and volumetric features achieved the highest AUCs of around 0.70 for predicting mild and severe progression, underscoring their utility in capturing global decline trajectories. In contrast, MRI embeddings from the ViT model were most effective in distinguishing cognitively stable individuals with an AUC of 0.71. However, all approaches struggled in the heterogeneous moderate group. These findings indicate that clinical features excel in identifying high-risk extremes, whereas transformer-based MRI embeddings are more sensitive to subtle markers of stability, motivating multimodal fusion strategies for AD progression modeling.",针对阿尔茨海默病（AD）认知衰退建模，本文评估了表格特征与基于 Transformer 的 MRI 嵌入的预测价值。通过动态时间规整（DTW）聚类引入轨迹感知标签，并利用无监督重建预训练 3D Vision Transformer (ViT) 以提取解剖保留嵌入。结果显示两者具有互补性：临床和体积特征在预测轻度和重度进展方面表现最佳（AUC约 0.70），擅长识别高风险极端情况；而 ViT 提取的 MRI 嵌入在区分认知稳定个体方面最有效（AUC 0.71），对细微稳定性标记更敏感，支持多模态融合策略。
2511.14599,CCSD: Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation for Robust Brain Tumor Segmentation with Missing Modalities,"The accurate segmentation of brain tumors from multi-modal MRI is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. While integrating complementary information from various MRI sequences is a common practice, the frequent absence of one or more modalities in real-world clinical settings poses a significant challenge, severely compromising the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Cross-Modal Compositional Self-Distillation (CCSD) framework that can flexibly handle arbitrary combinations of input modalities. CCSD adopts a shared-specific encoder-decoder architecture and incorporates two self-distillation strategies: (i) a hierarchical modality self-distillation mechanism that transfers knowledge across modality hierarchies to reduce semantic discrepancies, and (ii) a progressive modality combination distillation approach that enhances robustness to missing modalities by simulating gradual modality dropout during training. Extensive experiments on public brain tumor segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that CCSD achieves state-of-the-art performance across various missing-modality scenarios, with strong generalization and stability.",针对临床多模态脑肿瘤分割中常见的模态缺失问题，提出了跨模态组合自蒸馏（CCSD）框架。该方法采用共享-特定编码器-解码器架构，并引入两种自蒸馏策略：分层模态自蒸馏用于跨层级知识迁移以减少语义差异；渐进式模态组合蒸馏通过模拟模态丢失来增强鲁棒性。CCSD 能灵活处理任意模态组合，在公共脑肿瘤分割基准上的实验表明，其在各种模态缺失场景下均实现了 SOTA 性能，展现了强大的泛化能力和稳定性。
2511.14595,Rate-Distortion Guided Knowledge Graph Construction from Lecture Notes Using Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport,"Task-oriented knowledge graphs (KGs) enable AI-powered learning assistant systems to automatically generate high-quality multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Yet converting unstructured educational materials, such as lecture notes and slides, into KGs that capture key pedagogical content remains difficult. We propose a framework for knowledge graph construction and refinement grounded in rate-distortion (RD) theory and optimal transport geometry. In the framework, lecture content is modeled as a metric-measure space, capturing semantic and relational structure, while candidate KGs are aligned using Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) couplings to quantify semantic distortion. The rate term, expressed via the size of KG, reflects complexity and compactness. Refinement operators (add, merge, split, remove, rewire) minimize the rate-distortion Lagrangian, yielding compact, information-preserving KGs. Our prototype applied to data science lectures yields interpretable RD curves and shows that MCQs generated from refined KGs consistently surpass those from raw notes on fifteen quality criteria. This study establishes a principled foundation for information-theoretic KG optimization in personalized and AI-assisted education.",为从非结构化讲义生成高质量多项选择题（MCQ），提出一种基于率失真（RD）理论和格罗莫夫-瓦瑟斯坦（Gromov-Wasserstein）最优传输的知识图谱（KG）构建与优化框架。将讲义内容建模为度量测度空间，利用融合 FGW 耦合量化语义失真，通过图大小表征率项。利用添加、合并、分裂等算子最小化 RD 拉格朗日量，生成紧凑且信息保留的 KG。应用于数据科学讲义的原型显示，基于优化 KG 生成的 MCQ 在 15 项质量指标上均优于原始笔记生成的内容。
2511.14592,Is Your VLM for Autonomous Driving Safety-Ready? A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating External and In-Cabin Risks,"Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.",视觉语言模型（VLM）在自动驾驶中潜力巨大但安全性未经验证。本文发布了首个驾驶安全综合基准 DSBench，涵盖车外环境风险和车内驾驶行为安全两大类，共 10 个关键类别 28 个子项。对主流 VLM 的评估揭示了其在复杂安全场景下的显著性能下降。为此，构建了包含 9.8 万个实例的数据集专注于车内外安全场景，实验表明在该数据集上微调能显著提升现有 VLM 的安全感知能力，为自动驾驶技术的安全性评估与改进奠定了基础。
2511.14591,Biased Minds Meet Biased AI: How Class Imbalance Shapes Appropriate Reliance and Interacts with Human Base Rate Neglect,"Humans increasingly interact with artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making. However, both AI and humans are prone to biases. While AI and human biases have been studied extensively in isolation, this paper examines their complex interaction. Specifically, we examined how class imbalance as an AI bias affects people's ability to appropriately rely on an AI-based decision-support system, and how it interacts with base rate neglect as a human bias. In a within-subject online study (N= 46), participants classified three diseases using an AI-based decision-support system trained on either a balanced or unbalanced dataset. We found that class imbalance disrupted participants' calibration of AI reliance. Moreover, we observed mutually reinforcing effects between class imbalance and base rate neglect, offering evidence of a compound human-AI bias. Based on these findings, we advocate for an interactionist perspective and further research into the mutually reinforcing effects of biases in human-AI interaction.",本文探讨了 AI 偏差（类别不平衡）与人类偏差（基率忽略）在决策中的复杂交互。通过一项 N=46 的疾病分类实验，参与者使用在平衡或不平衡数据集上训练的 AI 辅助决策。结果发现，类别不平衡破坏了参与者对 AI 依赖的校准能力。更重要的是，观察到类别不平衡与基率忽略之间存在相互增强的效应，证实了复合人机偏差的存在。这表明需要从交互视角研究偏差，关注人机协作中偏差的相互强化作用。
2511.14588,Deep Learning-Based Regional White Matter Hyperintensity Mapping as a Robust Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease,"White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are key imaging markers in cognitive aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and related dementias. Although automated methods for WMH segmentation have advanced, most provide only global lesion load and overlook their spatial distribution across distinct white matter regions. We propose a deep learning framework for robust WMH segmentation and localization, evaluated across public datasets and an independent Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results show that the predicted lesion loads are in line with the reference WMH estimates, confirming the robustness to variations in lesion load, acquisition, and demographics. Beyond accurate segmentation, we quantify WMH load within anatomically defined regions and combine these measures with brain structure volumes to assess diagnostic value. Regional WMH volumes consistently outperform global lesion burden for disease classification, and integration with brain atrophy metrics further improves performance, reaching area under the curve (AUC) values up to 0.97. Several spatially distinct regions, particularly within anterior white matter tracts, are reproducibly associated with diagnostic status, indicating localized vulnerability in AD. These results highlight the added value of regional WMH quantification. Incorporating localized lesion metrics alongside atrophy markers may enhance early diagnosis and stratification in neurodegenerative disorders.",白质高信号（WMH）是阿尔茨海默病（AD）的关键标志，但现有方法常忽略其空间分布。本文提出一种深度学习框架，用于 WMH 的鲁棒分割与定位，并在 ADNI 队列上进行了验证。除了计算整体负荷，还量化了解剖区域内的局部 WMH，并结合脑萎缩指标进行评估。结果显示，区域 WMH 体积在疾病分类上优于全局负荷，结合萎缩指标后 AUC 高达 0.97。特别是前部白质束内的病变与诊断状态高度相关，表明局部病变指标结合萎缩标记可增强神经退行性疾病的早期诊断。
2511.14584,ReflexGrad: Three-Way Synergistic Architecture for Zero-Shot Generalization in LLM Agents,"Enabling agents to learn from experience and generalize across diverse tasks without task-specific training remains a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and decision-making. While recent approaches have explored episodic memory (Reflexion), gradient-based prompt optimization (TextGrad),and hierarchical task decomposition independently, their potential for synergistic integration remains unexplored. We introduce ReflexGrad, a novel architecture that tightly couples three complementary mechanisms: (1) LLM-based hierarchical TODO decomposition for strategic planning, (2) history-aware causal reflection that analyzes recent action patterns to identify failure root causes and enable within-trial learning, and (3) gradient-based optimization for systematic improvement. Unlike prior work relying on few-shot demonstrations, our system achieves true zero-shot generalization through pure LLM semantic reasoning,requiring no task-specific examples, fine-tuning, or hardcoded similarity metrics. Evaluated on ALFWorld benchmark tasks, ReflexGrad demonstrates 67% zero-shot success rate on Trial 0 without any prior task experience or demonstrations, establishing effective performance on first exposure. Through empirical analysis, we identify the architectural mechanisms underlying stable convergence (zero action loops) and effective cross-task transfer (67% to 78% improvement).Our work demonstrates that synergistic integration of complementary learning mechanisms enables robust zero-shot generalization that approaches few-shot baselines from prior work.",针对 LLM 智能体在无特定任务训练下的零样本泛化难题，提出了 ReflexGrad 架构。该架构紧密耦合了三种机制：（1）用于战略规划的层次化任务分解；（2）历史感知的因果反思，用于分析故障根源并实现试验内学习；（3）基于梯度的提示优化以系统性改进。在 ALFWorld 基准测试中，ReflexGrad 无需任何先验示例，在首次试验中即达到 67% 的零样本成功率，并通过架构协同实现了稳定的收敛和有效的跨任务迁移（提升至 78%），接近此前依赖少样本提示的方法。
2511.14567,SweeperBot: Making 3D Browsing Accessible through View Analysis and Visual Question Answering,"Accessing 3D models remains challenging for Screen Reader (SR) users. While some existing 3D viewers allow creators to provide alternative text, they often lack sufficient detail about the 3D models. Grounded on a formative study, this paper introduces SweeperBot, a system that enables SR users to leverage visual question answering to explore and compare 3D models. SweeperBot answers SR users' visual questions by combining an optimal view selection technique with the strength of generative- and recognition-based foundation models. An expert review with 10 Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) users with SR experience demonstrated the feasibility of using SweeperBot to assist BLV users in exploring and comparing 3D models.

2511.14566,Examining the Metrics for Document-Level Claim Extraction in Czech and Slovak,"Document-level claim extraction remains an open challenge in the field of fact-checking, and subsequently, methods for evaluating extracted claims have received limited attention. In this work, we explore approaches to aligning two sets of claims pertaining to the same source document and computing their similarity through an alignment score. We investigate techniques to identify the best possible alignment and evaluation method between claim sets, with the aim of providing a reliable evaluation framework. Our approach enables comparison between model-extracted and human-annotated claim sets, serving as a metric for assessing the extraction performance of models and also as a possible measure of inter-annotator agreement. We conduct experiments on newly collected dataset-claims extracted from comments under Czech and Slovak news articles-domains that pose additional challenges due to the informal language, strong local context, and subtleties of these closely related languages. The results draw attention to the limitations of current evaluation approaches when applied to document-level claim extraction and highlight the need for more advanced methods-ones able to correctly capture semantic similarity and evaluate essential claim properties such as atomicity, checkworthiness, and decontextualization.",针对捷克语和斯洛伐克语事实核查中篇章级观点提取评估方法的缺失，本文探索了对齐模型提取观点与人工标注观点的技术。通过计算对齐分数来衡量相似性，并在新收集的捷克/斯洛伐克新闻评论数据集上进行实验。结果表明，现有评估方法在处理非正式语言和强语境依赖时存在局限，无法准确捕捉语义相似性及观点的原子性、可核查性和去语境化属性。研究强调需要更先进的评估指标来适应篇章级观点提取的复杂性。
2511.14565,Masked IRL: LLM-Guided Reward Disambiguation from Demonstrations and Language,"Robots can adapt to user preferences by learning reward functions from demonstrations, but with limited data, reward models often overfit to spurious correlations and fail to generalize. This happens because demonstrations show robots how to do a task but not what matters for that task, causing the model to focus on irrelevant state details. Natural language can more directly specify what the robot should focus on, and, in principle, disambiguate between many reward functions consistent with the demonstrations. However, existing language-conditioned reward learning methods typically treat instructions as simple conditioning signals, without fully exploiting their potential to resolve ambiguity. Moreover, real instructions are often ambiguous themselves, so naive conditioning is unreliable. Our key insight is that these two input types carry complementary information: demonstrations show how to act, while language specifies what is important. We propose Masked Inverse Reinforcement Learning (Masked IRL), a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to combine the strengths of both input types. Masked IRL infers state-relevance masks from language instructions and enforces invariance to irrelevant state components. When instructions are ambiguous, it uses LLM reasoning to clarify them in the context of the demonstrations. In simulation and on a real robot, Masked IRL outperforms prior language-conditioned IRL methods by up to 15% while using up to 4.7 times less data, demonstrating improved sample-efficiency, generalization, and robustness to ambiguous language. Project page: https://MIT-CLEAR-Lab.github.io/Masked-IRL and Code: https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/Masked-IRL",针对从演示中学习奖励函数易过拟合无关状态细节的问题，提出了 Masked IRL 框架。该方法利用大语言模型（LLM）结合演示（展示如何行动）与自然语言指令（指定重点）的互补信息。Masked IRL 通过 LLM 从指令推断状态相关性掩码，强制模型对无关状态保持不变性，并利用 LLM 推理在演示上下文中消除指令歧义。仿真和真机实验表明，该方法比现有语言条件 IRL 方法性能提升 15%，且数据需求量减少 4.7 倍，显著提高了样本效率和对歧义语言的鲁棒性。
2511.14559,Apo2Mol: 3D Molecule Generation via Dynamic Pocket-Aware Diffusion Models,"Deep generative models are rapidly advancing structure-based drug design, offering substantial promise for generating small molecule ligands that bind to specific protein targets. However, most current approaches assume a rigid protein binding pocket, neglecting the intrinsic flexibility of proteins and the conformational rearrangements induced by ligand binding, limiting their applicability in practical drug discovery. Here, we propose Apo2Mol, a diffusion-based generative framework for 3D molecule design that explicitly accounts for conformational flexibility in protein binding pockets. To support this, we curate a dataset of over 24,000 experimentally resolved apo-holo structure pairs from the Protein Data Bank, enabling the characterization of protein structure changes associated with ligand binding. Apo2Mol employs a full-atom hierarchical graph-based diffusion model that simultaneously generates 3D ligand molecules and their corresponding holo pocket conformations from input apo states. Empirical studies demonstrate that Apo2Mol can achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating high-affinity ligands and accurately capture realistic protein pocket conformational changes.",针对现有药物设计生成模型忽视蛋白质结合口袋柔性及配体结合诱导构象变化的问题，提出了 Apo2Mol。这是一个基于全原子分层图扩散的生成框架，能够从输入的无配体（apo）状态同时生成 3D 配体分子及其对应的有配体（holo）口袋构象。基于 PDB 中超过 2.4 万对实验解析的 apo-holo 结构对训练，实证研究表明 Apo2Mol 在生成高亲和力配体方面达到 SOTA 水平，并能准确捕捉真实的蛋白质口袋构象变化。
2511.14555,DecNefLab: A Modular and Interpretable Simulation Framework for Decoded Neurofeedback,"Decoded Neurofeedback (DecNef) is a flourishing non-invasive approach to brain modulation with wide-ranging applications in neuromedicine and cognitive neuroscience. However, progress in DecNef research remains constrained by subject-dependent learning variability, reliance on indirect measures to quantify progress, and the high cost and time demands of experimentation.   We present DecNefLab, a modular and interpretable simulation framework that formalizes DecNef as a machine learning problem. Beyond providing a virtual laboratory, DecNefLab enables researchers to model, analyze and understand neurofeedback dynamics. Using latent variable generative models as simulated participants, DecNefLab allows direct observation of internal cognitive states and systematic evaluation of how different protocol designs and subject characteristics influence learning.   We demonstrate how this approach can (i) reproduce empirical phenomena of DecNef learning, (ii) identify conditions under which DecNef feedback fails to induce learning, and (iii) guide the design of more robust and reliable DecNef protocols in silico before human implementation.   In summary, DecNefLab bridges computational modeling and cognitive neuroscience, offering a principled foundation for methodological innovation, robust protocol design, and ultimately, a deeper understanding of DecNef-based brain modulation.",解码神经反馈（DecNef）受限于受试者学习差异及昂贵的实验成本。本文推出了 DecNefLab，一个将 DecNef 形式化为机器学习问题的模块化可解释仿真框架。通过使用潜变量生成模型作为模拟参与者，DecNefLab 允许直接观察内部认知状态，并系统评估协议设计与受试者特征对学习的影响。该框架不仅能复现经验现象并识别学习失败条件，还能在人体实验前通过计算机模拟（in silico）指导设计更鲁棒的 DecNef 协议，为脑调节研究提供了理论基础。
2511.14543,MissHDD: Hybrid Deterministic Diffusion for Hetrogeneous Incomplete Data Imputation,"Incomplete data are common in real-world tabular applications, where numerical, categorical, and discrete attributes coexist within a single dataset. This heterogeneous structure presents significant challenges for existing diffusion-based imputation models, which typically assume a homogeneous feature space and rely on stochastic denoising trajectories. Such assumptions make it difficult to maintain conditional consistency, and they often lead to information collapse for categorical variables or instability when numerical variables require deterministic updates. These limitations indicate that a single diffusion process is insufficient for mixed-type tabular imputation.   We propose a hybrid deterministic diffusion framework that separates heterogeneous features into two complementary generative channels. A continuous DDIM-based channel provides efficient and stable deterministic denoising for numerical variables, while a discrete latent-path diffusion channel, inspired by loopholing-based discrete diffusion, models categorical and discrete features without leaving their valid sample manifolds. The two channels are trained under a unified conditional imputation objective, enabling coherent reconstruction of mixed-type incomplete data.   Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets show that the proposed framework achieves higher imputation accuracy, more stable sampling trajectories, and improved robustness across MCAR, MAR, and MNAR settings compared with existing diffusion-based and classical methods. These results demonstrate the importance of structure-aware diffusion processes for advancing deep learning approaches to incomplete tabular data.",针对混合类型（数值、分类、离散）表格数据缺失填补中单一扩散模型难以兼顾条件一致性和稳定性的问题，提出了混合确定性扩散框架 MissHDD。该方法将特征分离为双通道：基于连续 DDIM 的通道对数值变量进行稳定的确定性去噪；基于 loopholing 的离散潜在路径扩散通道在有效样本流形内对分类和离散特征建模。双通道在统一条件填补目标下训练。实验表明，MissHDD 在 MCAR、MAR 和 MNAR 设置下的填补精度、采样轨迹稳定性和鲁棒性均优于现有扩散及经典方法。
2511.14533,A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Reasoning under Perceptual Uncertainty: Bridging Continuous Perception and Discrete Symbolic Planning,"Bridging continuous perceptual signals and discrete symbolic reasoning is a fundamental challenge in AI systems that must operate under uncertainty. We present a neuro-symbolic framework that explicitly models and propagates uncertainty from perception to planning, providing a principled connection between these two abstraction levels. Our approach couples a transformer-based perceptual front-end with graph neural network (GNN) relational reasoning to extract probabilistic symbolic states from visual observations, and an uncertainty-aware symbolic planner that actively gathers information when confidence is low. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on tabletop robotic manipulation as a concrete application: the translator processes 10,047 PyBullet-generated scenes (3--10 objects) and outputs probabilistic predicates with calibrated confidences (overall F1=0.68). When embedded in the planner, the system achieves 94\%/90\%/88\% success on Simple Stack, Deep Stack, and Clear+Stack benchmarks (90.7\% average), exceeding the strongest POMDP baseline by 10--14 points while planning within 15\,ms. A probabilistic graphical-model analysis establishes a quantitative link between calibrated uncertainty and planning convergence, providing theoretical guarantees that are validated empirically. The framework is general-purpose and can be applied to any domain requiring uncertainty-aware reasoning from perceptual input to symbolic planning.",针对 AI 系统在不确定性下连接连续感知与离散符号推理的挑战，提出了一种显式建模并传播感知不确定性的神经符号框架。该方法结合 Transformer 和图神经网络（GNN）从视觉观测中提取带校准置信度的概率符号状态，并利用不确定性感知符号规划器在低置信度时主动收集信息。在机器人堆叠任务中，该系统处理了 1 万多个场景，平均成功率达 90.7%，超越最强 POMDP 基线 10-14 个百分点，且规划时间仅需 15 毫秒，证明了校准不确定性与规划收敛之间的理论联系。
2511.14515,IMSE: Efficient U-Net-based Speech Enhancement using Inception Depthwise Convolution and Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention,"Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a significant challenge for speech enhancement (SE) tasks on resource-constrained devices. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as MUSE, have established a strong baseline with only 0.51M parameters by introducing a Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) transformer and Deformable Embedding (DE). However, an in-depth analysis reveals that MUSE still suffers from efficiency bottlenecks: the MET module relies on a complex ""approximate-compensate"" mechanism to mitigate the limitations of Taylor-expansion-based attention, while the offset calculation for deformable embedding introduces additional computational burden. This paper proposes IMSE, a systematically optimized and ultra-lightweight network. We introduce two core innovations: 1) Replacing the MET module with Amplitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA). MALA fundamentally rectifies the ""amplitude-ignoring"" problem in linear attention by explicitly preserving the norm information of query vectors in the attention calculation, achieving efficient global modeling without an auxiliary compensation branch. 2) Replacing the DE module with Inception Depthwise Convolution (IDConv). IDConv borrows the Inception concept, decomposing large-kernel operations into efficient parallel branches (square, horizontal, and vertical strips), thereby capturing spectrogram features with extremely low parameter redundancy. Extensive experiments on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset demonstrate that, compared to the MUSE baseline, IMSE significantly reduces the parameter count by 16.8\% (from 0.513M to 0.427M) while achieving competitive performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on the PESQ metric (3.373). This study sets a new benchmark for the trade-off between model size and speech quality in ultra-lightweight speech enhancement.",针对轻量级语音增强（SE）任务，提出了 IMSE 网络，旨在解决现有 SOTA 模型 MUSE 计算效率不足的问题。IMSE 引入两项核心创新：1）利用幅度感知线性注意力（MALA）替代 MET 模块，通过保留查询向量范数信息解决线性注意力的幅度忽略问题，无需辅助分支；2）采用 Inception 深度卷积（IDConv）替代可变形嵌入，通过分解大核为高效并行条状分支降低参数冗余。在 VoiceBank+DEMAND 数据集上，IMSE 将参数量减少 16.8%（至 0.427M）的同时，PESQ 得分达 3.373，实现了模型大小与语音质量的新平衡。
2511.14488,Towards Stable and Structured Time Series Generation with Perturbation-Aware Flow Matching,"Time series generation is critical for a wide range of applications, which greatly supports downstream analytical and decision-making tasks. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneous induced by localized perturbations present significant challenges for generating structurally consistent time series. While flow matching provides a promising paradigm by modeling temporal dynamics through trajectory-level supervision, it fails to adequately capture abrupt transitions in perturbed time series, as the use of globally shared parameters constrains the velocity field to a unified representation. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{PAFM}, a \textbf{P}erturbation-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{F}low \textbf{M}atching framework that models perturbed trajectories to ensure stable and structurally consistent time series generation. The framework incorporates perturbation-guided training to simulate localized disturbances and leverages a dual-path velocity field to capture trajectory deviations under perturbation, enabling refined modeling of perturbed behavior to enhance the structural coherence. In order to further improve sensitivity to trajectory perturbations while enhancing expressiveness, a mixture-of-experts decoder with flow routing dynamically allocates modeling capacity in response to different trajectory dynamics. Extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation tasks demonstrate that PAFM consistently outperforms strong baselines. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PAFM-03B2.",针对时间序列生成中局部扰动导致的异质性和突变难以捕捉的问题，提出了扰动感知流匹配（PAFM）框架。PAFM 通过扰动引导训练模拟局部干扰，并利用双路径速度场捕捉扰动下的轨迹偏差，从而精细建模受扰行为并增强结构连贯性。此外，引入具有流路由机制的混合专家（MoE）解码器，根据不同的轨迹动态动态分配建模能力。实验表明，PAFM 在无条件和有条件生成任务中均优于强基线，有效解决了全局共享参数导致的统一速度场限制。

This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for ""agentic AI,"" with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.",代理式 AI（Agentic AI）作为超越传统 AI 代理的新范式，正在电力工程领域兴起。本文建立了一套精确的定义和分类法，以区分代理式 AI 与现有范式。通过介绍四个详细的电力工程应用案例——包括用于简化电力系统研究的代理框架和电池换电站动态定价生存分析系统——展示了其实际影响。此外，针对部署风险，文章详细调查了故障模式，并为设计安全、可靠和负责任的代理式 AI 系统提供了可操作的建议和指导。
2511.14476,"Operationalizing Pluralistic Values in Large Language Model Alignment Reveals Trade-offs in Safety, Inclusivity, and Model Behavior","Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained using human feedback for safety and alignment with human values, alignment decisions often overlook human social diversity. This study examines how incorporating pluralistic values affects LLM behavior by systematically evaluating demographic variation and design parameters in the alignment pipeline. We collected alignment data from US and German participants (N = 1,095, 27,375 ratings) who rated LLM responses across five dimensions: Toxicity, Emotional Awareness (EA), Sensitivity, Stereotypical Bias, and Helpfulness. We fine-tuned multiple Large Language Models and Large Reasoning Models using preferences from different social groups while varying rating scales, disagreement handling methods, and optimization techniques. The results revealed systematic demographic effects: male participants rated responses 18% less toxic than female participants; conservative and Black participants rated responses 27.9% and 44% more emotionally aware than liberal and White participants, respectively. Models fine-tuned on group-specific preferences exhibited distinct behaviors. Technical design choices showed strong effects: the preservation of rater disagreement achieved roughly 53% greater toxicity reduction than majority voting, and 5-point scales yielded about 22% more reduction than binary formats; and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) consistently outperformed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in multi-value optimization. These findings represent a preliminary step in answering a critical question: How should alignment balance expert-driven and user-driven signals to ensure both safety and fair representation?",为研究多元价值观对 LLM 对齐的影响，本文收集了美德两国 1095 名参与者的对齐数据，涵盖毒性、情感意识等五个维度。研究发现显著的人口统计学差异：例如，保守派和黑人参与者对情感意识的评分显著不同。技术层面，保留评分者分歧比多数投票法多减少 53% 的毒性，5 分制量表比二元制多减少 22%，且直接偏好优化（DPO）在多值优化中优于群体相对策略优化（GRPO）。结果表明，对齐策略需平衡专家与用户信号，并考虑社会多样性。
2511.14465,nnterp: A Standardized Interface for Mechanistic Interpretability of Transformers,"Mechanistic interpretability research requires reliable tools for analyzing transformer internals across diverse architectures. Current approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: custom implementations like TransformerLens ensure consistent interfaces but require coding a manual adaptation for each architecture, introducing numerical mismatch with the original models, while direct HuggingFace access through NNsight preserves exact behavior but lacks standardization across models. To bridge this gap, we develop nnterp, a lightweight wrapper around NNsight that provides a unified interface for transformer analysis while preserving original HuggingFace implementations. Through automatic module renaming and comprehensive validation testing, nnterp enables researchers to write intervention code once and deploy it across 50+ model variants spanning 16 architecture families. The library includes built-in implementations of common interpretability methods (logit lens, patchscope, activation steering) and provides direct access to attention probabilities for models that support it. By packaging validation tests with the library, researchers can verify compatibility with custom models locally. nnterp bridges the gap between correctness and usability in mechanistic interpretability tooling.",针对机械可解释性研究中工具易用性与数值精确性之间的权衡，开发了 nnterp 库。作为 NNsight 的轻量级封装，nnterp 提供了统一的 Transformer 分析接口，同时保留了 HuggingFace 模型的原始数值行为。通过自动模块重命名和验证测试，它支持 16 个架构系列的 50 多种模型变体。库中内置了 Logit Lens、Patchscope 和激活转向等常用可解释性方法。nnterp 解决了现有工具中需手动适配架构或缺乏标准化的痛点，兼顾了正确性与可用性。
2511.14461,Effective Diversification of Multi-Carousel Book Recommendation,"Using multiple carousels, lists that wrap around and can be scrolled, is the basis for offering content in most contemporary movie streaming platforms. Carousels allow for highlighting different aspects of users' taste, that fall in categories such as genres and authors. However, while carousels offer structure and greater ease of navigation, they alone do not increase diversity in recommendations, while this is essential to keep users engaged. In this work we propose several approaches to effectively increase item diversity within the domain of book recommendations, on top of a collaborative filtering algorithm. These approaches are intended to improve book recommendations in the web catalogs of public libraries. Furthermore, we introduce metrics to evaluate the resulting strategies, and show that the proposed system finds a suitable balance between accuracy and beyond-accuracy aspects.",针对公共图书馆网络目录中多轮播（Multi-Carousel）界面仅提供导航便利但缺乏推荐多样性的问题，本文在协同过滤算法之上提出了多种提升项目多样性（如体裁和作者）的策略。通过引入新的评估指标，实验证明所提出的系统在保持推荐准确性的同时，有效地平衡了多样性等超准确性（beyond-accuracy）指标，从而在基于轮播的界面中提供更具吸引力的书籍推荐。
2511.14456,Analyzing the Impact of Participant Failures in Cross-Silo Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm for training machine learning (ML) models without sharing data. While applying FL in cross-silo scenarios, where organizations collaborate, it is necessary that the FL system is reliable; however, participants can fail due to various reasons (e.g., communication issues or misconfigurations). In order to provide a reliable system, it is necessary to analyze the impact of participant failures. While this problem received attention in cross-device FL where mobile devices with limited resources participate, there is comparatively little research in cross-silo FL.   Therefore, we conduct an extensive study for analyzing the impact of participant failures on the model quality in the context of inter-organizational cross-silo FL with few participants. In our study, we focus on analyzing generally influential factors such as the impact of the timing and the data as well as the impact on the evaluation, which is important for deciding, if the model should be deployed. We show that under high skews the evaluation is optimistic and hides the real impact. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the timing impacts the quality of the trained model. Our results offer insights for researchers and software architects aiming to build robust FL systems.",在组织间协作的跨孤岛联邦学习（cross-silo FL）中，参与者故障对系统可靠性构成挑战。本研究针对参与者较少的跨孤岛 FL 场景，深入分析了参与者故障对模型质量的影响。研究发现，在数据高度倾斜的情况下，评估结果往往过于乐观，掩盖了故障的真实影响。此外，故障发生的时机对训练模型的质量有显著影响。这些发现为构建稳健的联邦学习系统提供了关键见解。
2511.14452,Hybrid Modeling of Photoplethysmography for Non-invasive Monitoring of Cardiovascular Parameters,"Continuous cardiovascular monitoring can play a key role in precision health. However, some fundamental cardiac biomarkers of interest, including stroke volume and cardiac output, require invasive measurements, e.g., arterial pressure waveforms (APW). As a non-invasive alternative, photoplethysmography (PPG) measurements are routinely collected in hospital settings. Unfortunately, the prediction of key cardiac biomarkers from PPG instead of APW remains an open challenge, further complicated by the scarcity of annotated PPG measurements. As a solution, we propose a hybrid approach that uses hemodynamic simulations and unlabeled clinical data to estimate cardiovascular biomarkers directly from PPG signals. Our hybrid model combines a conditional variational autoencoder trained on paired PPG-APW data with a conditional density estimator of cardiac biomarkers trained on labeled simulated APW segments. As a key result, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect fluctuations of cardiac output and stroke volume and outperform a supervised baseline in monitoring temporal changes in these biomarkers.",针对心脏生物标志物（如每搏输出量和心输出量）依赖有创动脉压力波形（APW）测量的问题，本文提出一种基于光电容积脉搏波（PPG）的无创混合建模方法。该方法结合血流动力学模拟与未标记临床数据，利用在配对 PPG-APW 数据上训练的条件变分自编码器（CVAE），以及在标记模拟 APW 片段上训练的心脏生物标志物条件密度估计器。实验表明，该方法能有效检测心输出量和每搏输出量的波动，在监测时间变化方面优于监督基线，解决了 PPG 数据标注稀缺的难题。
2511.14446,Agentic Video Intelligence: A Flexible Framework for Advanced Video Exploration and Understanding,"Video understanding requires not only visual recognition but also complex reasoning. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they typically process videos largely in a single-pass manner with limited support for evidence revisit and iterative refinement. While recently emerging agent-based methods enable long-horizon reasoning, they either depend heavily on expensive proprietary models or require extensive agentic RL training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI), a flexible and training-free framework that can mirror human video comprehension through system-level design and optimization. AVI introduces three key innovations: (1) a human-inspired three-phase reasoning process (Retrieve-Perceive-Review) that ensures both sufficient global exploration and focused local analysis, (2) a structured video knowledge base organized through entity graphs, along with multi-granularity integrated tools, constituting the agent's interaction environment, and (3) an open-source model ensemble combining reasoning LLMs with lightweight base CV models and VLM, eliminating dependence on proprietary APIs or RL training. Experiments on LVBench, VideoMME-Long, LongVideoBench, and Charades-STA demonstrate that AVI achieves competitive performance while offering superior interpretability.",针对现有视频理解方法在复杂推理和迭代细化方面的局限，提出了 Agentic Video Intelligence (AVI) 框架。AVI 无需训练，通过系统级设计模拟人类视频理解过程，引入了“检索-感知-回顾”三阶段推理机制，结合实体图结构的视频知识库和多粒度工具。该框架集成了开源推理 LLM、轻量级 CV 模型和 VLM，摆脱了对专有 API 或 RL 训练的依赖。在 LVBench、VideoMME-Long 等基准测试中，AVI 展现了具有竞争力的性能和优越的可解释性。
2511.14445,"Tell Me: An LLM-powered Mental Well-being Assistant with RAG, Synthetic Dialogue Generation, and Agentic Planning","We present Tell Me, a mental well-being system that leverages advances in large language models to provide accessible, context-aware support for users and researchers. The system integrates three components: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) assistant for personalized, knowledge-grounded dialogue; (ii) a synthetic client-therapist dialogue generator conditioned on client profiles to facilitate research on therapeutic language and data augmentation; and (iii) a Well-being AI crew, implemented with CrewAI, that produces weekly self-care plans and guided meditation audio. The system is designed as a reflective space for emotional processing rather than a substitute for professional therapy. It illustrates how conversational assistants can lower barriers to support, complement existing care, and broaden access to mental health resources. To address the shortage of confidential therapeutic data, we introduce synthetic client-therapist dialogue generation conditioned on client profiles. Finally, the planner demonstrates an innovative agentic workflow for dynamically adaptive, personalized self-care, bridging the limitations of static well-being tools. We describe the architecture, demonstrate its functionalities, and report evaluation of the RAG assistant in curated well-being scenarios using both automatic LLM-based judgments and a human-user study.

2511.14435,Watchdogs and Oracles: Runtime Verification Meets Large Language Models for Autonomous Systems,"Assuring the safety and trustworthiness of autonomous systems is particularly difficult when learning-enabled components and open environments are involved. Formal methods provide strong guarantees but depend on complete models and static assumptions. Runtime verification (RV) complements them by monitoring executions at run time and, in its predictive variants, by anticipating potential violations. Large language models (LLMs), meanwhile, excel at translating natural language into formal artefacts and recognising patterns in data, yet they remain error-prone and lack formal guarantees. This vision paper argues for a symbiotic integration of RV and LLMs. RV can serve as a guardrail for LLM-driven autonomy, while LLMs can extend RV by assisting specification capture, supporting anticipatory reasoning, and helping to handle uncertainty. We outline how this mutual reinforcement differs from existing surveys and roadmaps, discuss challenges and certification implications, and identify future research directions towards dependable autonomy.",针对自主系统的安全性和可信度保障难题，本文提出运行时验证（RV）与大语言模型（LLM）的共生融合愿景。RV 可作为 LLM 驱动自主性的安全护栏，提供实时监控和违规预测；而 LLM 则可辅助 RV 进行规范捕获、支持预期推理并处理不确定性。文章探讨了这种相互强化的机制如何区别于现有研究，分析了挑战与认证影响，并指明了通往可靠自主性的未来研究方向。
2511.14428,"Context-aware, Ante-hoc Explanations of Driving Behaviour","Autonomous vehicles (AVs) must be both safe and trustworthy to gain social acceptance and become a viable option for everyday public transportation. Explanations about the system behaviour can increase safety and trust in AVs. Unfortunately, explaining the system behaviour of AI-based driving functions is particularly challenging, as decision-making processes are often opaque. The field of Explainability Engineering tackles this challenge by developing explanation models at design time. These models are designed from system design artefacts and stakeholder needs to develop correct and good explanations. To support this field, we propose an approach that enables context-aware, ante-hoc explanations of (un)expectable driving manoeuvres at runtime. The visual yet formal language Traffic Sequence Charts is used to formalise explanation contexts, as well as corresponding (un)expectable driving manoeuvres. A dedicated runtime monitoring enables context-recognition and ante-hoc presentation of explanations at runtime. In combination, we aim to support the bridging of correct and good explanations. Our method is demonstrated in a simulated overtaking.",针对自动驾驶车辆（AV）AI 决策过程不透明的问题，提出了一种上下文感知的事前（ante-hoc）驾驶行为解释方法。利用视觉化形式语言 Traffic Sequence Charts 形式化解释上下文及预期/非预期驾驶动作，并通过专用运行时监控实现上下文识别和解释呈现。该方法在模拟超车场景中得到验证，旨在增强 AV 的安全性和信任度。
2511.14426,MiAD: Mirage Atom Diffusion for De Novo Crystal Generation,"In recent years, diffusion-based models have demonstrated exceptional performance in searching for simultaneously stable, unique, and novel (S.U.N.) crystalline materials. However, most of these models don't have the ability to change the number of atoms in the crystal during the generation process, which limits the variability of model sampling trajectories. In this paper, we demonstrate the severity of this restriction and introduce a simple yet powerful technique, mirage infusion, which enables diffusion models to change the state of the atoms that make up the crystal from existent to non-existent (mirage) and vice versa. We show that this technique improves model quality by up to $\times2.5$ compared to the same model without this modification. The resulting model, Mirage Atom Diffusion (MiAD), is an equivariant joint diffusion model for de novo crystal generation that is capable of altering the number of atoms during the generation process. MiAD achieves an $8.2\%$ S.U.N. rate on the MP-20 dataset, which substantially exceeds existing state-of-the-art approaches. The source code can be found at \href{https://github.com/andrey-okhotin/miad.git}{\texttt{github.com/andrey-okhotin/miad}}.",针对现有扩散模型在晶体生成中无法改变原子数量的限制，本文提出了“幻影注入”（mirage infusion）技术，允许原子在存在与不存在（幻影）状态间切换。基于此技术构建的 MiAD（Mirage Atom Diffusion）模型是一个等变联合扩散模型，能在生成过程中动态调整原子数量。实验表明，该技术将模型质量提升了 2.5 倍，MiAD 在 MP-20 数据集上达到了 8.2% 的 S.U.N.（稳定、独特、新颖）率，显著优于现有 SOTA 方法。
2511.14422,Sigil: Server-Enforced Watermarking in U-Shaped Split Federated Learning via Gradient Injection,"In decentralized machine learning paradigms such as Split Federated Learning (SFL) and its variant U-shaped SFL, the server's capabilities are severely restricted. Although this enhances client-side privacy, it also leaves the server highly vulnerable to model theft by malicious clients. Ensuring intellectual property protection for such capability-limited servers presents a dual challenge: watermarking schemes that depend on client cooperation are unreliable in adversarial settings, whereas traditional server-side watermarking schemes are technically infeasible because the server lacks access to critical elements such as model parameters or labels.   To address this challenge, this paper proposes Sigil, a mandatory watermarking framework designed specifically for capability-limited servers. Sigil defines the watermark as a statistical constraint on the server-visible activation space and embeds the watermark into the client model via gradient injection, without requiring any knowledge of the data. Besides, we design an adaptive gradient clipping mechanism to ensure that our watermarking process remains both mandatory and stealthy, effectively countering existing gradient anomaly detection methods and a specifically designed adaptive subspace removal attack. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models demonstrate Sigil's fidelity, robustness, and stealthiness.",针对 U 型拆分联邦学习（U-shaped SFL）中服务器能力受限导致的模型窃取风险，提出了 Sigil 强制水印框架。Sigil 将水印定义为服务器可见激活空间上的统计约束，并通过梯度注入将水印嵌入客户端模型，无需数据先验知识。结合自适应梯度裁剪机制，Sigil 确保了水印的强制性和隐蔽性，有效抵御梯度异常检测和自适应子空间移除攻击。多数据集实验验证了其保真度、鲁棒性和隐蔽性。
2511.14396,Continuous Vision-Language-Action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment for Behavioral Cloning,"Language-conditioned manipulation facilitates human-robot interaction via behavioral cloning (BC), which learns control policies from human demonstrations and serves as a cornerstone of embodied AI. Overcoming compounding errors in sequential action decisions remains a central challenge to improving BC performance. Existing approaches mitigate compounding errors through data augmentation, expressive representation, or temporal abstraction. However, they suffer from physical discontinuities and semantic-physical misalignment, leading to inaccurate action cloning and intermittent execution. In this paper, we present Continuous vision-language-action Co-Learning with Semantic-Physical Alignment (CCoL), a novel BC framework that ensures temporally consistent execution and fine-grained semantic grounding. It generates robust and smooth action execution trajectories through continuous co-learning across vision, language, and proprioceptive inputs (e.g., robot internal states). Meanwhile, we anchor language semantics to visuomotor representations by a bidirectional cross-attention to learn contextual information for action generation, successfully overcoming the problem of semantic-physical misalignment. Extensive experiments show that CCoL achieves an average 8.0% relative improvement across three simulation suites, with up to 19.2% relative gain in human-demonstrated bimanual insertion tasks. Real-world tests on a 7-DoF robot further confirm CCoL's generalization under unseen and noisy object states.",针对语言条件行为克隆（BC）中存在的物理不连续和语义-物理错位问题，提出了 CCoL 框架。该方法通过视觉、语言和本体感觉输入的连续协同学习，生成平滑且鲁棒的动作轨迹。利用双向交叉注意力机制将语言语义锚定到视觉运动表征，实现细粒度的语义接地。实验表明，CCoL 在三个模拟套件中平均相对提升 8.0%，在双臂插入任务中提升高达 19.2%，并在 7-DoF 机器人真机测试中展现了对未见及噪声状态的强泛化能力。
2511.14386,Cheating Stereo Matching in Full-scale: Physical Adversarial Attack against Binocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Driving,"Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.",针对自动驾驶中双目深度估计的物理对抗攻击研究空白，本文提出了首个基于全局迷彩纹理的 3D 物理对抗样本（PAE）攻击方法。通过新的 3D 立体匹配渲染模块解决视差效应，实现 PAE 在双目视觉中的精准对齐。进一步提出了融合攻击策略，通过细粒度优化使目标无缝融入环境，显著提升了隐蔽性和攻击效果。评估表明，该 PAE 能成功诱导立体匹配模型产生错误的深度信息。
2511.14365,The Tokenization Bottleneck: How Vocabulary Extension Improves Chemistry Representation Learning in Pretrained Language Models,"The application of large language models (LLMs) to chemistry is frequently hampered by a ""tokenization bottleneck"", where tokenizers tuned on general-domain text tend to fragment chemical representations such as SMILES into semantically uninformative sub-tokens. This paper introduces a principled methodology to resolve this bottleneck by unifying the representation of natural language and molecular structures within a single model. Our approach involves targeted vocabulary extension-augmenting a pretrained LLM's vocabulary with chemically salient tokens, followed by continued pretraining on chemistry-domain text to integrate this new knowledge. We provide an empirical demonstration of the effectiveness of this strategy, showing that our methodology leads to superior performance on a range of downstream chemical tasks.",针对 LLM 在化学领域因通用分词器将 SMILES 等化学式碎片化导致的“分词瓶颈”，本文提出了一种通过针对性词汇扩展来统一自然语言与分子结构表示的方法。该方法向预训练 LLM 词汇表中添加具有化学显著性的 token，并在化学领域文本上进行持续预训练以整合新知识。实证研究表明，该策略显著提升了模型在下游化学任务中的性能。

2511.14334,When Words Change the Model: Sensitivity of LLMs for Constraint Programming Modelling,"One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.",针对 LLM 在约束编程建模中看似成功的表现，本研究通过系统重述和扰动经典 CSPLib 问题（保留结构但修改上下文及引入误导元素），检验了其是否源于数据污染而非真实推理。对比三种代表性 LLM 在原始与修改描述下的表现，发现尽管 LLM 能生成语法有效的模型，但在上下文和语言变化下性能急剧下降，揭示了其对措辞的敏感性及理解的浅薄性。
2511.14322,LSP-YOLO: A Lightweight Single-Stage Network for Sitting Posture Recognition on Embedded Devices,"With the rise in sedentary behavior, health problems caused by poor sitting posture have drawn increasing attention. Most existing methods, whether using invasive sensors or computer vision, rely on two-stage pipelines, which result in high intrusiveness, intensive computation, and poor real-time performance on embedded edge devices. Inspired by YOLOv11-Pose, a lightweight single-stage network for sitting posture recognition on embedded edge devices termed LSP-YOLO was proposed. By integrating partial convolution(PConv) and Similarity-Aware Activation Module(SimAM), a lightweight module, Light-C3k2, was designed to reduce computational cost while maintaining feature extraction capability. In the recognition head, keypoints were directly mapped to posture classes through pointwise convolution, and intermediate supervision was employed to enable efficient fusion of pose estimation and classification. Furthermore, a dataset containing 5,000 images across six posture categories was constructed for model training and testing. The smallest trained model, LSP-YOLO-n, achieved 94.2% accuracy and 251 Fps on personal computer(PC) with a model size of only 1.9 MB.

2511.14312,H-LDM: Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Models for Controllable and Interpretable PCG Synthesis from Clinical Metadata,"Phonocardiogram (PCG) analysis is vital for cardiovascular disease diagnosis, yet the scarcity of labeled pathological data hinders the capability of AI systems. To bridge this, we introduce H-LDM, a Hierarchical Latent Diffusion Model for generating clinically accurate and controllable PCG signals from structured metadata.

2511.14302,SAM-Fed: SAM-Guided Federated Semi-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation,"Medical image segmentation is clinically important, yet data privacy and the cost of expert annotation limit the availability of labeled data. Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) offers a solution but faces two challenges: pseudo-label reliability depends on the strength of local models, and client devices often require compact or heterogeneous architectures due to limited computational resources. These constraints reduce the quality and stability of pseudo-labels, while large models, though more accurate, cannot be trained or used for routine inference on client devices. We propose SAM-Fed, a federated semi-supervised framework that leverages a high-capacity segmentation foundation model to guide lightweight clients during training. SAM-Fed combines dual knowledge distillation with an adaptive agreement mechanism to refine pixel-level supervision. Experiments on skin lesion and polyp segmentation across homogeneous and heterogeneous settings show that SAM-Fed consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL methods.",针对医学图像分割中数据隐私、标注成本及客户端资源受限的问题，提出了 SAM-Fed 联邦半监督学习框架。该方法利用大容量分割基础模型（SAM）指导轻量级客户端训练，结合双重知识蒸馏与自适应协议机制优化像素级监督，解决了伪标签质量低及设备异构性难题。在皮肤病变和息肉分割实验中，SAM-Fed 在同构和异构设置下均显著优于现有 FSSL 方法。

With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), LLM-driven agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for automating data analysis and insight discovery. However, existing data insight agents remain limited in several key aspects, often failing to deliver satisfactory results due to: (1) insufficient utilization of domain knowledge, (2) shallow analytical depth, and (3) error-prone code generation during insight generation. To address these issues, we propose DataSage, a novel multi-agent framework that incorporates three innovative features including external knowledge retrieval to enrich the analytical context, a multi-role debating mechanism to simulate diverse analytical perspectives and deepen analytical depth, and multi-path reasoning to improve the accuracy of the generated code and insights. Extensive experiments on InsightBench demonstrate that DataSage consistently outperforms existing data insight agents across all difficulty levels, offering an effective solution for automated data insight discovery.",针对现有数据洞察智能体在领域知识利用、分析深度及代码生成准确性方面的不足，提出了 DataSage 多智能体框架。该框架融合了外部知识检索以丰富分析背景，采用多角色辩论机制模拟多元分析视角以加深分析深度，并利用多路径推理提高代码和洞察生成的准确性。在 InsightBench 上的实验表明，DataSage 在各难度级别上均优于现有智能体，有效提升了自动化数据洞察发现的能力。

Additionally, 3D scene generation is vital for advancing embodied AI and world models, which depend on diverse, high-quality scenes for learning and evaluation. In this work, we propose Gen3d, a novel method for generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes from a single image. After the initial point cloud is created by lifting the RGBD image, Gen3d maintains and expands its world model. The 3D scene is finalized through optimizing a Gaussian splatting representation.

2511.14282,Weight Variance Amplifier Improves Accuracy in High-Sparsity One-Shot Pruning,"Deep neural networks achieve outstanding performance in visual recognition tasks, yet their large number of parameters makes them less practical for real-world applications. Recently, one-shot pruning has emerged as an effective strategy for reducing model size without additional training. However, models trained with standard objective functions often suffer a significant drop in accuracy after aggressive pruning. Some existing pruning-robust optimizers, such as SAM, and CrAM, mitigate this accuracy drop by guiding the model toward flatter regions of the parameter space, but they inevitably incur non-negligible additional computations. We propose a Variance Amplifying Regularizer (VAR) that deliberately increases the variance of model parameters during training. Our study reveals an intriguing finding that parameters with higher variance exhibit greater pruning robustness. VAR exploits this property by promoting such variance in the weight distribution, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of pruning. We further provide a theoretical analysis of its convergence behavior, supported by extensive empirical results demonstrating the superior pruning robustness of VAR.",针对深度神经网络单次剪枝（one-shot pruning）导致的精度下降问题，本文提出了一种方差放大正则化器（VAR）。研究发现参数方差越大，剪枝鲁棒性越强。VAR 通过在训练期间刻意增加模型参数的方差来利用这一特性，从而减轻剪枝的不利影响，且无需像 SAM 或 CrAM 那样增加大量计算。理论分析和实证结果均证明 VAR 显著提升了高稀疏度下的模型精度和剪枝鲁棒性。
2511.14276,Comparing Task-Agnostic Embedding Models for Tabular Data,"Recent foundation models for tabular data achieve strong task-specific performance via in-context learning. Nevertheless, they focus on direct prediction by encapsulating both representation learning and task-specific inference inside a single, resource-intensive network. This work specifically focuses on representation learning, i.e., on transferable, task-agnostic embeddings. We systematically evaluate task-agnostic representations from tabular foundation models (TabPFN and TabICL) alongside with classical feature engineering (TableVectorizer) across a variety of application tasks as outlier detection (ADBench) and supervised learning (TabArena Lite). We find that simple TableVectorizer features achieve comparable or superior performance while being up to three orders of magnitude faster than tabular foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/ContactSoftwareAI/TabEmbedBench.",针对表格数据基础模型计算密集且偏向任务特定预测的问题，本文评估了 TabPFN 和 TabICL 的任务无关嵌入表征能力，并与经典特征工程方法 TableVectorizer 进行对比。在异常检测（ADBench）和监督学习（TabArena Lite）任务上的评估显示，简单的 TableVectorizer 特征在性能上可与基础模型媲美甚至更优，且速度快三个数量级。这表明在追求通用表征时，传统特征工程仍具有极高的效率和竞争力。
2511.14262,Object-Centric World Models for Causality-Aware Reinforcement Learning,"World models have been developed to support sample-efficient deep reinforcement learning agents. However, it remains challenging for world models to accurately replicate environments that are high-dimensional, non-stationary, and composed of multiple objects with rich interactions since most world models learn holistic representations of all environmental components. By contrast, humans perceive the environment by decomposing it into discrete objects, facilitating efficient decision-making. Motivated by this insight, we propose \emph{Slot Transformer Imagination with CAusality-aware reinforcement learning} (STICA), a unified framework in which object-centric Transformers serve as the world model and causality-aware policy and value networks. STICA represents each observation as a set of object-centric tokens, together with tokens for the agent action and the resulting reward, enabling the world model to predict token-level dynamics and interactions. The policy and value networks then estimate token-level cause--effect relations and use them in the attention layers, yielding causality-guided decision-making. Experiments on object-rich benchmarks demonstrate that STICA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art agents in both sample efficiency and final performance.",针对现有世界模型难以准确复现高维、非平稳且富含对象交互环境的问题，受人类离散对象感知启发，提出了 STICA 框架。该框架利用以对象为中心的 Transformer 构建世界模型，将观测分解为对象级 Token 进行动态和交互预测。同时，引入因果感知策略和价值网络，估计 Token 级的因果关系并用于注意力层，实现因果引导决策。在多对象基准测试中，STICA 在样本效率和最终性能上均优于 SOTA 智能体。
2511.14256,PathMind: A Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason Framework for Knowledge Graph Reasoning with Large Language Models,"Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is the task of inferring new knowledge by performing logical deductions on knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks. Despite promising success, current LLM-based KGR methods still face two critical limitations. First, existing methods often extract reasoning paths indiscriminately, without assessing their different importance, which may introduce irrelevant noise that misleads LLMs. Second, while many methods leverage LLMs to dynamically explore potential reasoning paths, they require high retrieval demands and frequent LLM calls. To address these limitations, we propose PathMind, a novel framework designed to enhance faithful and interpretable reasoning by selectively guiding LLMs with important reasoning paths. Specifically, PathMind follows a ""Retrieve-Prioritize-Reason"" paradigm. First, it retrieves a query subgraph from KG through the retrieval module. Next, it introduces a path prioritization mechanism that identifies important reasoning paths using a semantic-aware path priority function, which simultaneously considers the accumulative cost and the estimated future cost for reaching the target. Finally, PathMind generates accurate and logically consistent responses via a dual-phase training strategy, including task-specific instruction tuning and path-wise preference alignment. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PathMind consistently outperforms competitive baselines, particularly on complex reasoning tasks with fewer input tokens, by identifying essential reasoning paths.",针对 LLM 在知识图谱推理（KGR）中路径提取噪声大及调用成本高的问题，提出了 PathMind 框架。该框架遵循“检索-排序-推理”范式：通过语义感知路径优先级函数（综合累计成本与未来估算成本）筛选关键路径，减少噪声；采用双阶段训练策略（任务指令微调与路径偏好对齐）生成忠实且逻辑一致的回答。实验表明，PathMind 在复杂推理任务上以更少的输入 Token 实现了超越 SOTA 的性能，显著提升了推理的准确性和可解释性。
2511.14248,Enhancing Regional Airbnb Trend Forecasting Using LLM-Based Embeddings of Accessibility and Human Mobility,"The expansion of short-term rental platforms, such as Airbnb, has significantly disrupted local housing markets, often leading to increased rental prices and housing affordability issues. Accurately forecasting regional Airbnb market trends can thus offer critical insights for policymakers and urban planners aiming to mitigate these impacts. This study proposes a novel time-series forecasting framework to predict three key Airbnb indicators -- Revenue, Reservation Days, and Number of Reservations -- at the regional level. Using a sliding-window approach, the model forecasts trends 1 to 3 months ahead. Unlike prior studies that focus on individual listings at fixed time points, our approach constructs regional representations by integrating listing features with external contextual factors such as urban accessibility and human mobility. We convert structured tabular data into prompt-based inputs for a Large Language Model (LLM), producing comprehensive regional embeddings. These embeddings are then fed into advanced time-series models (RNN, LSTM, Transformer) to better capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics. Experiments on Seoul's Airbnb dataset show that our method reduces both average RMSE and MAE by approximately 48% compared to conventional baselines, including traditional statistical and machine learning models. Our framework not only improves forecasting accuracy but also offers practical insights for detecting oversupplied regions and supporting data-driven urban policy decisions.",针对 Airbnb 扩张对住房市场的影响，提出了一种融合 LLM 嵌入的区域趋势预测框架，用于预测收入、预订天数和预订数量。该方法不仅考虑房源特征，还整合了城市可达性和人类流动性等外部环境因素，将结构化数据转化为 Prompt 输入 LLM 生成区域嵌入，并结合 RNN/LSTM/Transformer 捕捉时空动态。在首尔数据集上的实验显示，该方法较传统基线将 RMSE 和 MAE 降低约 48%，为政策制定者提供了检测供过于求区域的数据支持。
2511.14230,ArbESC+: Arabic Enhanced Edit Selection System Combination for Grammatical Error Correction Resolving conflict and improving system combination in Arabic GEC,"Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) is an important aspect of natural language processing. Arabic has a complicated morphological and syntactic structure, posing a greater challenge than other languages. Even though modern neural models have improved greatly in recent years, the majority of previous attempts used individual models without taking into account the potential benefits of combining different systems. In this paper, we present one of the first multi-system approaches for correcting grammatical errors in Arabic, the Arab Enhanced Edit Selection System Complication (ArbESC+). Several models are used to collect correction proposals, which are represented as numerical features in the framework. A classifier determines and implements the appropriate corrections based on these features. In order to improve output quality, the framework uses support techniques to filter overlapping corrections and estimate decision reliability. A combination of AraT5, ByT5, mT5, AraBART, AraBART+Morph+GEC, and Text editing systems gave better results than a single model alone, with F0.5 at 82.63% on QALB-14 test data, 84.64% on QALB-15 L1 data, and 65.55% on QALB-15 L2 data. As one of the most significant contributions of this work, it's the first Arab attempt to integrate linguistic error correction. Improving existing models provides a practical step towards developing advanced tools that will benefit users and researchers of Arabic text processing.",针对阿拉伯语语法错误纠正（GEC）的复杂性，提出了首个多系统组合框架 ArbESC+。该方法集成 AraT5、ByT5 等多个模型的纠正建议，将其转化为数值特征，并通过分类器选择最佳纠正。利用重叠过滤和决策可靠性估计技术提升质量。在 QALB-14/15 数据集上，F0.5 分数分别达到 82.63% 和 84.64%，显著优于单模型，证明了系统组合在处理复杂形态语言 GEC 中的有效性。
2511.14227,DevPiolt: Operation Recommendation for IoT Devices at Xiaomi Home,"Operation recommendation for IoT devices refers to generating personalized device operations for users based on their context, such as historical operations, environment information, and device status. This task is crucial for enhancing user satisfaction and corporate profits. Existing recommendation models struggle with complex operation logic, diverse user preferences, and sensitive to suboptimal suggestions, limiting their applicability to IoT device operations. To address these issues, we propose DevPiolt, a LLM-based recommendation model for IoT device operations. Specifically, we first equip the LLM with fundamental domain knowledge of IoT operations via continual pre-training and multi-task fine-tuning. Then, we employ direct preference optimization to align the fine-tuned LLM with specific user preferences. Finally, we design a confidence-based exposure control mechanism to avoid negative user experiences from low-quality recommendations. Extensive experiments show that DevPiolt significantly outperforms baselines on all datasets, with an average improvement of 69.5% across all metrics. DevPiolt has been practically deployed in Xiaomi Home app for one quarter, providing daily operation recommendations to 255,000 users. Online experiment results indicate a 21.6% increase in unique visitor device coverage and a 29.1% increase in page view acceptance rates.",针对物联网设备操作推荐中逻辑复杂、用户偏好多样及对次优建议敏感的问题，提出了基于 LLM 的推荐模型 DevPiolt。该方法通过持续预训练和多任务微调赋予 LLM 物联网领域知识，利用直接偏好优化（DPO）对齐用户偏好，并设计基于置信度的曝光控制机制以避免低质推荐。实验显示各项指标平均提升 69.5%。在小米米家 App 实际部署中，覆盖 25.5 万用户，设备覆盖率提升 21.6%，采纳率提升 29.1%。
2511.14221,LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization for Local-Life Recommendation,"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enhanced text-based recommendation by enriching traditional ID-based methods with semantic generalization capabilities. Text-based methods typically encode item textual information via prompt design and generate discrete semantic IDs through item tokenization. However, in domain-specific tasks such as local-life services, simply injecting location information into prompts fails to capture fine-grained spatial characteristics and real-world distance awareness among items. To address this, we propose LGSID, an LLM-Aligned Geographic Item Tokenization Framework for Local-life Recommendation. This framework consists of two key components: (1) RL-based Geographic LLM Alignment, and (2) Hierarchical Geographic Item Tokenization. In the RL-based alignment module, we initially train a list-wise reward model to capture real-world spatial relationships among items. We then introduce a novel G-DPO algorithm that uses pre-trained reward model to inject generalized spatial knowledge and collaborative signals into LLMs while preserving their semantic understanding. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical geographic item tokenization strategy, where primary tokens are derived from discrete spatial and content attributes, and residual tokens are refined using the aligned LLM's geographic representation vectors. Extensive experiments on real-world Kuaishou industry datasets show that LGSID consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discriminative and generative recommendation models. Ablation studies, visualizations, and case studies further validate its effectiveness.",针对本地生活推荐中现有文本方法难以捕捉细粒度空间特征的问题，提出了 LGSID 框架。该方法包含 RL 基于地理的 LLM 对齐和分层地理项目 Tokenization。利用列表级奖励模型捕捉空间关系，并通过 G-DPO 算法将空间知识注入 LLM。同时，采用分层 Tokenization 策略，结合离散空间属性与对齐后的 LLM 地理表征向量。在快手数据集上的实验表明，LGSID 在推荐性能上显著优于 SOTA 模型，有效增强了空间感知能力。
2511.14220,Parallelizing Tree Search with Twice Sequential Monte Carlo,"Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage search are responsible for many milestone breakthroughs in RL. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) recently emerged as an alternative to the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm which drove these breakthroughs. SMC is easier to parallelize and more suitable to GPU acceleration. However, it also suffers from large variance and path degeneracy which prevent it from scaling well with increased search depth, i.e., increased sequential compute. To address these problems, we introduce Twice Sequential Monte Carlo Tree Search (TSMCTS). Across discrete and continuous environments TSMCTS outperforms the SMC baseline as well as a popular modern version of MCTS. Through variance reduction and mitigation of path degeneracy, TSMCTS scales favorably with sequential compute while retaining the properties that make SMC natural to parallelize.",针对序列蒙特卡洛（SMC）在强化学习搜索中存在的方差大和路径退化问题，提出了二次序列蒙特卡洛树搜索（TSMCTS）。该方法通过方差缩减和缓解路径退化，在保持 SMC 易并行化（适合 GPU 加速）特性的同时，显著提升了随搜索深度增加的可扩展性。在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，TSMCTS 优于 SMC 基线及现代 MCTS 变体。
2511.14219,Listen Like a Teacher: Mitigating Whisper Hallucinations using Adaptive Layer Attention and Knowledge Distillation,"The Whisper model, an open-source automatic speech recognition system, is widely adopted for its strong performance across multilingual and zero-shot settings. However, it frequently suffers from hallucination errors, especially under noisy acoustic conditions. Previous works to reduce hallucinations in Whisper-style ASR systems have primarily focused on audio preprocessing or post-processing of transcriptions to filter out erroneous content. However, modifications to the Whisper model itself remain largely unexplored to mitigate hallucinations directly. To address this challenge, we present a two-stage architecture that first enhances encoder robustness through Adaptive Layer Attention (ALA) and further suppresses hallucinations using a multi-objective knowledge distillation (KD) framework. In the first stage, ALA groups encoder layers into semantically coherent blocks via inter-layer correlation analysis. A learnable multi-head attention module then fuses these block representations, enabling the model to jointly exploit low- and high-level features for more robust encoding. In the second stage, our KD framework trains the student model on noisy audio to align its semantic and attention distributions with a teacher model processing clean inputs. Our experiments on noisy speech benchmarks show notable reductions in hallucinations and word error rates, while preserving performance on clean speech. Together, ALA and KD offer a principled strategy to improve Whisper's reliability under real-world noisy conditions.",针对 Whisper 模型在噪声环境下易产生幻觉的问题，提出了结合自适应层注意力（ALA）和知识蒸馏（KD）的双阶段架构。ALA 通过层间相关性分析将编码器层分组，并利用可学习多头注意力融合特征，增强编码鲁棒性。多目标 KD 框架利用处理纯净输入的教师模型指导处理噪声输入的学生模型，对齐语义和注意力分布。实验表明，该方法在噪声基准上显著减少了幻觉和词错误率，同时保持了纯净语音的性能，直接优化了模型本身的可靠性。
2511.14218,Bridging the Gap Between Bayesian Deep Learning and Ensemble Weather Forecasts,"Weather forecasting is fundamentally challenged by the chaotic nature of the atmosphere, necessitating probabilistic approaches to quantify uncertainty. While traditional ensemble prediction (EPS) addresses this through computationally intensive simulations, recent advances in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) offer a promising but often disconnected alternative. We bridge these paradigms through a unified hybrid Bayesian Deep Learning framework for ensemble weather forecasting that explicitly decomposes predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, learned via variational inference and a physics-informed stochastic perturbation scheme modeling flow-dependent atmospheric dynamics, respectively. We further establish a unified theoretical framework that rigorously connects BDL and EPS, providing formal theorems that decompose total predictive uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components under the hybrid BDL framework. We validate our framework on the large-scale 40-year ERA5 reanalysis dataset (1979-2019) with 0.25° spatial resolution. Experimental results show that our method not only improves forecast accuracy and yields better-calibrated uncertainty quantification but also achieves superior computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art probabilistic diffusion models. We commit to making our code open-source upon acceptance of this paper.",针对天气预报中的不确定性量化，提出了统一混合贝叶斯深度学习（BDL）框架，连接了传统集合预报（EPS）与 BDL。该框架通过变分推断学习认知不确定性，并通过模拟流依赖大气动力学的物理感知随机扰动方案学习偶然不确定性。理论上建立了 BDL 与 EPS 的联系，并在 ERA5 数据集上进行了验证。结果显示，该方法在预测精度、不确定性校准及计算效率上均优于 SOTA 概率扩散模型，有效实现了高效可靠的集合天气预报。
2511.14214,Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Understand Chronology?,"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in finance and economics, where prompt-based attempts against look-ahead bias implicitly assume that models understand chronology. We test this fundamental question with a series of chronological ordering tasks with increasing complexities over facts the model already knows from pre-training. Our tasks cover (1) chronological ordering, (2) conditional sorting (filter, then order), and (3) anachronism detection. We evaluate GPT-4.1, Claude-3.7 Sonnet, with and without Extended Thinking (ET), and GPT-5 across multiple reasoning-effort settings. Across models, Exact match rate drops sharply as sequences lengthen even while rank correlations stay high as LLMs largely preserve local order but struggle to maintain a single globally consistent timeline. In conditional sorting, most failures stem from the filtering step rather than the ordering step, but GPT-5 and Claude-3.7 Sonnet with Extended Thinking outshine normal models significantly. Lastly, anachronism detection is found to be the easiest task for the LLMs but performance still declines with increasingly overlapping timelines or entities. Overall, our main contribution is showing that allocating explicit reasoning budget helps with chronological ordering with GPT-5 at medium/high reasoning effort achieving flawless ordering at all lengths and perfect conditional sorting (both self-filtered and given-subset), whereas low/minimal effort degrades with longer lists, mirroring earlier models. Our findings delineate limits of current LLMs on chronological tasks, providing insights into task complexity, and demonstrate scenarios in which reasoning helps. These patterns are important for the real-time application of LLMs in finance. We release all code and evaluation templates to support full reproducibility.",针对 LLM 是否真正理解时间顺序的问题，通过时间排序、条件排序和时代错乱检测任务进行了系统测试。结果发现，随着序列变长，精确匹配率急剧下降，模型虽能保持局部顺序但难以维持全局一致的时间线。GPT-5 和带 Extended Thinking 的 Claude-3.7 在高推理预算下表现显著优于普通模型，能实现完美排序和条件筛选。研究表明分配显式推理预算对处理时间顺序至关重要，这对金融等领域的实时应用具有重要意义。

2511.14203,Multi-Scale Correlation-Aware Transformer for Maritime Vessel Re-Identification,"Maritime vessel re-identification (Re-ID) plays a crucial role in advancing maritime monitoring and intelligent situational awareness systems. However, some existing vessel Re-ID methods are directly adapted from pedestrian-focused algorithms, making them ill-suited for mitigating the unique problems present in vessel images, particularly the greater intra-identity variations and more severe missing of local parts, which lead to the emergence of outlier samples within the same identity. To address these challenges, we propose the Multi-scale Correlation-aware Transformer Network (MCFormer), which explicitly models multi-scale correlations across the entire input set to suppress the adverse effects of outlier samples with intra-identity variations or local missing, incorporating two novel modules, the Global Correlation Module (GCM), and the Local Correlation Module (LCM). Specifically, GCM constructs a global similarity affinity matrix across all input images to model global correlations through feature aggregation based on inter-image consistency, rather than solely learning features from individual images as in most existing approaches. Simultaneously, LCM mines and aligns local features of positive samples with contextual similarity to extract local correlations by maintaining a dynamic memory bank, effectively compensating for missing or occluded regions in individual images. To further enhance feature robustness, MCFormer integrates global and local features that have been respectively correlated across multiple scales, effectively capturing latent relationships among image features. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.",针对海上船舶重识别（Re-ID）中存在的类内差异大及局部缺失严重问题，提出了多尺度相关感知 Transformer 网络（MCFormer）。通过全局相关模块（GCM）构建全局相似性亲和矩阵，利用图像间一致性聚合特征；通过局部相关模块（LCM）利用动态记忆库挖掘正样本上下文相似性，补偿缺失区域。MCFormer 融合多尺度全局与局部特征，有效抑制了离群样本影响，在三个基准测试中达到了 SOTA 性能。
2511.14199,HFL-FlowLLM: Large Language Models for Network Traffic Flow Classification in Heterogeneous Federated Learning,"In modern communication networks driven by 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT), effective network traffic flow classification is crucial for Quality of Service (QoS) management and security. Traditional centralized machine learning struggles with the distributed data and privacy concerns in these heterogeneous environments, while existing federated learning approaches suffer from high costs and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose HFL-FlowLLM, which to our knowledge is the first framework to apply large language models to network traffic flow classification in heterogeneous federated learning. Compared to state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods for network traffic flow classification, the proposed approach improves the average F1 score by approximately 13%, demonstrating compelling performance and strong robustness. When compared to existing large language models federated learning frameworks, as the number of clients participating in each training round increases, the proposed method achieves up to a 5% improvement in average F1 score while reducing the training costs by about 87%.

2511.14198,DiverseClaire: Simulating Students to Improve Introductory Programming Course Materials for All CS1 Learners,"Although CS programs are booming, introductory courses like CS1 still adopt a one-size-fits-all formats that can exacerbate cognitive load and discourage learners with autism, ADHD, dyslexia and other neurological conditions. These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score.

2511.14186,Few-Shot Precise Event Spotting via Unified Multi-Entity Graph and Distillation,"Precise event spotting (PES) aims to recognize fine-grained events at exact moments and has become a key component of sports analytics. This task is particularly challenging due to rapid succession, motion blur, and subtle visual differences. Consequently, most existing methods rely on domain-specific, end-to-end training with large labeled datasets and often struggle in few-shot conditions due to their dependence on pixel- or pose-based inputs alone. However, obtaining large labeled datasets is practically hard. We propose a Unified Multi-Entity Graph Network (UMEG-Net) for few-shot PES. UMEG-Net integrates human skeletons and sport-specific object keypoints into a unified graph and features an efficient spatio-temporal extraction module based on advanced GCN and multi-scale temporal shift. To further enhance performance, we employ multimodal distillation to transfer knowledge from keypoint-based graphs to visual representations. Our approach achieves robust performance with limited labeled data and significantly outperforms baseline models in few-shot settings, providing a scalable and effective solution for few-shot PES.

2511.14178,Towards Deploying VLA without Fine-Tuning: Plug-and-Play Inference-Time VLA Policy Steering via Embodied Evolutionary Diffusion,"Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential in real-world robotic manipulation. However, pre-trained VLA policies still suffer from substantial performance degradation during downstream deployment. Although fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, its reliance on costly demonstration collection and intensive computation makes it impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce VLA-Pilot, a plug-and-play inference-time policy steering method for zero-shot deployment of pre-trained VLA without any additional fine-tuning or data collection. We evaluate VLA-Pilot on six real-world downstream manipulation tasks across two distinct robotic embodiments, encompassing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-Pilot substantially boosts the success rates of off-the-shelf pre-trained VLA policies, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to diverse tasks and embodiments.

2511.14172,SymLoc: Symbolic Localization of Hallucination across HaluEval and TruthfulQA,"LLMs still struggle with hallucination, especially when confronted with symbolic triggers like modifiers, negation, numbers, exceptions, and named entities. Yet, we lack a clear understanding of where these symbolic hallucinations originate, making it crucial to systematically handle such triggers and localize the emergence of hallucination inside the model. While prior work explored localization using statistical techniques like LSC and activation variance analysis, these methods treat all tokens equally and overlook the role symbolic linguistic knowledge plays in triggering hallucinations. So far, no approach has investigated how symbolic elements specifically drive hallucination failures across model layers, nor has symbolic linguistic knowledge been used as the foundation for a localization framework. We propose the first symbolic localization framework that leverages symbolic linguistic and semantic knowledge to meaningfully trace the development of hallucinations across all model layers. By focusing on how models process symbolic triggers, we analyze five models using HaluEval and TruthfulQA. Our symbolic knowledge approach reveals that attention variance for these linguistic elements explodes to critical instability in early layers (2-4), with negation triggering catastrophic variance levels, demonstrating that symbolic semantic processing breaks down from the very beginning. Through the lens of symbolic linguistic knowledge, despite larger model sizes, hallucination rates remain consistently high (78.3%-83.7% across Gemma variants), with steep attention drops for symbolic semantic triggers throughout deeper layers. Our findings demonstrate that hallucination is fundamentally a symbolic linguistic processing failure, not a general generation problem, revealing that symbolic semantic knowledge provides the key to understanding and localizing hallucination mechanisms in LLMs.",针对 LLM 在处理符号触发词（如否定、修饰符）时产生的幻觉，提出了 SymLoc 符号定位框架。该框架利用语言和语义知识追踪幻觉在模型层间的演变。分析显示，符号触发词的注意力方差在早期层（2-4层）爆炸式增长导致不稳定，特别是否定词引发灾难性方差，表明符号语义处理在初期即崩溃。研究发现幻觉本质上是符号语言处理的失败，而非一般生成问题，为理解和定位幻觉机制提供了新视角。
2511.14169,AdaTok: Adaptive Token Compression with Object-Aware Representations for Efficient Multimodal LLMs,"Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated substantial value in unified text-image understanding and reasoning, primarily by converting images into sequences of patch-level tokens that align with their architectural paradigm. However, patch-level tokenization leads to a quadratic growth in image tokens, burdening MLLMs' understanding and reasoning with enormous computation and memory. Additionally, the traditional patch-wise scanning tokenization workflow misaligns with the human vision cognition system, further leading to hallucination and computational redundancy. To address this issue, we propose an object-level token merging strategy for Adaptive Token compression, revealing the consistency with human vision system. The experiments are conducted on multiple comprehensive benchmarks, which show that our approach averagely, utilizes only 10% tokens while achieving almost 96% of the vanilla model's performance. More extensive experimental results in comparison with relevant works demonstrate the superiority of our method in balancing compression ratio and performance. Our code will be available.",针对 MLLM 中 patch 级 Tokenization 导致的计算冗余及与人类视觉认知不符的问题，提出了 AdaTok 自适应 Token 压缩策略。该方法采用对象级 Token 合并，与人类视觉系统一致。实验显示，该方法仅使用 10% 的 Token 即可达到原模型 96% 的性能，在平衡压缩率与性能方面显著优于现有方法，大幅降低了计算和内存负担。
2511.14168,Certified Signed Graph Unlearning,"Signed graphs model complex relationships through positive and negative edges, with widespread real-world applications. Given the sensitive nature of such data, selective removal mechanisms have become essential for privacy protection. While graph unlearning enables the removal of specific data influences from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing methods are designed for conventional GNNs and overlook the unique heterogeneous properties of signed graphs. When applied to Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs), these methods lose critical sign information, degrading both model utility and unlearning effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose Certified Signed Graph Unlearning (CSGU), which provides provable privacy guarantees while preserving the sociological principles underlying SGNNs. CSGU employs a three-stage method: (1) efficiently identifying minimal influenced neighborhoods via triangular structures, (2) applying sociological theories to quantify node importance for optimal privacy budget allocation, and (3) performing importance-weighted parameter updates to achieve certified modifications with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSGU outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance in both utility preservation and unlearning effectiveness on SGNNs.",针对有符号图（Signed Graph）隐私保护中遗忘特定数据的需求，提出了 CSGU 认证有符号图遗忘框架。该方法解决了现有 GNN 遗忘方法忽视符号异质性导致的信息丢失问题。CSGU 包含三阶段：利用三角形结构识别最小影响邻域；应用社会学理论量化节点重要性以分配隐私预算；执行重要性加权参数更新。实验表明，CSGU 在保护模型效用和遗忘效果上均优于现有方法，并提供了可证明的隐私保证。
2511.14166,Selective Weak-to-Strong Generalization,"Future superhuman models will surpass the ability of humans and humans will only be able to \textit{weakly} supervise superhuman models. To alleviate the issue of lacking high-quality data for model alignment, some works on weak-to-strong generalization (W2SG) finetune a strong pretrained model with a weak supervisor so that it can generalize beyond weak supervision. However, the invariable use of weak supervision in existing methods exposes issues in robustness, with a proportion of weak labels proving harmful to models. In this paper, we propose a selective W2SG framework to avoid using weak supervision when unnecessary. We train a binary classifier P(IK) to identify questions that a strong model can answer and use its self-generated labels for alignment. We further refine weak labels with a graph smoothing method. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms competitive baselines. Further analyses show that P(IK) can generalize across tasks and difficulties, which indicates selective W2SG can help superalignment.",针对弱监督强模型（W2SG）中全量使用弱标签导致的鲁棒性问题，提出了选择性 W2SG 框架。该方法训练二分类器 P(IK) 识别强模型可自行回答的问题，优先使用自生成标签而非弱标签进行对齐，并利用图平滑方法优化弱标签。实验表明，该方法在三个基准上显著优于基线，P(IK) 具有良好的跨任务泛化性，有助于超对齐研究。
2511.14148,AsyncVLA: Asynchronous Flow Matching for Vision-Language-Action Models,"Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for building generalist robots. However, traditional VLA models that generate actions through flow matching (FM) typically rely on rigid and uniform time schedules, i.e., synchronous FM (SFM). Without action context awareness and asynchronous self-correction, SFM becomes unstable in long-horizon tasks, where a single action error can cascade into failure. In this work, we propose asynchronous flow matching VLA (AsyncVLA), a novel framework that introduces temporal flexibility in asynchronous FM (AFM) and enables self-correction in action generation. AsyncVLA breaks from the vanilla SFM in VLA models by generating the action tokens in a non-uniform time schedule with action context awareness. Besides, our method introduces the confidence rater to extract confidence of the initially generated actions, enabling the model to selectively refine inaccurate action tokens before execution. Moreover, we propose a unified training procedure for SFM and AFM that endows a single model with both modes, improving KV-cache utilization. Extensive experiments on robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that AsyncVLA is data-efficient and exhibits self-correction ability. AsyncVLA achieves state-of-the-art results across general embodied evaluations due to its asynchronous generation in AFM. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuhuaJiang2002/AsyncVLA.",针对传统 VLA 模型中同步流匹配（SFM）缺乏动作上下文感知和自校正能力的问题，提出了 AsyncVLA 框架。该方法引入异步流匹配（AFM），通过非均匀时间调度生成动作 Token，并利用置信度评分器选择性修正不准确动作。采用统一训练流程支持 SFM 和 AFM 模式，提高了 KV 缓存利用率。实验显示，AsyncVLA 在机器人操作基准上展现了数据高效性和自校正能力，达到了 SOTA 水平。
2511.14143,SMART: Shot-Aware Multimodal Video Moment Retrieval with Audio-Enhanced MLLM,"Video Moment Retrieval is a task in video understanding that aims to localize a specific temporal segment in an untrimmed video based on a natural language query. Despite recent progress in moment retrieval from videos using both traditional techniques and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), most existing methods still rely on coarse temporal understanding and a single visual modality, limiting performance on complex videos. To address this, we introduce \textit{S}hot-aware \textit{M}ultimodal \textit{A}udio-enhanced \textit{R}etrieval of \textit{T}emporal \textit{S}egments (SMART), an MLLM-based framework that integrates audio cues and leverages shot-level temporal structure. SMART enriches multimodal representations by combining audio and visual features while applying \textbf{Shot-aware Token Compression}, which selectively retains high-information tokens within each shot to reduce redundancy and preserve fine-grained temporal details. We also refine prompt design to better utilize audio-visual cues. Evaluations on Charades-STA and QVHighlights show that SMART achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including a 1.61\% increase in R1@0.5 and 2.59\% gain in R1@0.7 on Charades-STA.",针对视频片段检索中单一模态和粗糙时间理解的局限，提出了 SMART 框架。该方法结合音频线索和镜头级时间结构，通过音频-视觉特征融合丰富多模态表征，并采用镜头感知 Token 压缩技术减少冗余并保留细粒度细节。在 Charades-STA 和 QVHighlights 上的实验表明，SMART 显著提升了检索精度，优于现有 SOTA 方法。
2511.14136,Beyond Accuracy: A Multi-Dimensional Framework for Evaluating Enterprise Agentic AI Systems,"Current agentic AI benchmarks predominantly evaluate task completion accuracy, while overlooking critical enterprise requirements such as cost-efficiency, reliability, and operational stability. Through systematic analysis of 12 main benchmarks and empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art agents, we identify three fundamental limitations: (1) absence of cost-controlled evaluation leading to 50x cost variations for similar precision, (2) inadequate reliability assessment where agent performance drops from 60\% (single run) to 25\% (8-run consistency), and (3) missing multidimensional metrics for security, latency, and policy compliance. We propose \textbf{CLEAR} (Cost, Latency, Efficacy, Assurance, Reliability), a holistic evaluation framework specifically designed for enterprise deployment. Evaluation of six leading agents on 300 enterprise tasks demonstrates that optimizing for accuracy alone yields agents 4.4-10.8x more expensive than cost-aware alternatives with comparable performance. Expert evaluation (N=15) confirms that CLEAR better predicts production success (correlation $ρ=0.83$) compared to accuracy-only evaluation ($ρ=0.41$).",针对现有 AI 智能体基准仅关注准确性而忽视企业需求（成本、可靠性等）的问题，提出了 CLEAR 评估框架（涵盖成本、延迟、功效、保障、可靠性）。通过对 6 个主流智能体在 300 项任务上的评估发现，仅优化准确性会导致成本高出 4.4-10.8 倍。CLEAR 框架在预测生产成功率方面与专家评估的相关性（0.83）远高于仅基于准确性的评估（0.41），为企业级 AI 部署提供了更全面的指导。
2511.14135,Fair-GNE : Generalized Nash Equilibrium-Seeking Fairness in Multiagent Healthcare Automation,"Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p < 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.",针对多智能体医疗自动化中工作负载分配公平性问题，提出了 Fair-GNE 框架。该方法将 MARL 建模为约束广义纳什均衡（GNE）博弈，通过自适应约束执行实现不可变且自我强制的公平性，而非依赖事后奖励重塑。在复苏模拟器中的实验表明，Fair-GNE 在保持 86% 任务成功率的同时，显著提升了工作负载平衡（JFI 从 0.33 升至 0.89），实现了更具原则性的公平性保障。
2511.14131,"Run, Ruminate, and Regulate: A Dual-process Thinking System for Vision-and-Language Navigation","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to dynamically explore complex 3D environments following human instructions. Recent research underscores the potential of harnessing large language models (LLMs) for VLN, given their commonsense knowledge and general reasoning capabilities. Despite their strengths, a substantial gap in task completion performance persists between LLM-based approaches and domain experts, as LLMs inherently struggle to comprehend real-world spatial correlations precisely. Additionally, introducing LLMs is accompanied with substantial computational cost and inference latency. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-process thinking framework dubbed R3, integrating LLMs' generalization capabilities with VLN-specific expertise in a zero-shot manner. The framework comprises three core modules: Runner, Ruminator, and Regulator. The Runner is a lightweight transformer-based expert model that ensures efficient and accurate navigation under regular circumstances. The Ruminator employs a powerful multimodal LLM as the backbone and adopts chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to elicit structured reasoning. The Regulator monitors the navigation progress and controls the appropriate thinking mode according to three criteria, integrating Runner and Ruminator harmoniously. Experimental results illustrate that R3 significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, exceeding 3.28% and 3.30% in SPL and RGSPL respectively on the REVERIE benchmark. This pronounced enhancement highlights the effectiveness of our method in handling challenging VLN tasks.",针对 LLM 在视觉语言导航（VLN）中空间理解不足及计算成本高的问题，提出了 R3 双过程思维框架。该框架包含 Runner（轻量级专家模型负责常规导航）、Ruminator（多模态 LLM 进行 CoT 推理）和 Regulator（动态切换思维模式）。在 REVERIE 基准上的实验显示，R3 优于 SOTA 方法，SPL 和 RGSPL 分别提升了 3.28% 和 3.30%，有效结合了专家效率与 LLM 泛化能力。
2511.14130,PRISM: Prompt-Refined In-Context System Modelling for Financial Retrieval,"With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), financial information retrieval has become a critical industrial application. Extracting task-relevant information from lengthy financial filings is essential for both operational and analytical decision-making. The FinAgentBench dataset formalizes this problem through two tasks: document ranking and chunk ranking. We present PRISM, a training-free framework that integrates refined system prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and a lightweight multi-agent system. Each component is examined extensively to reveal their synergies: prompt engineering provides precise task instructions, ICL supplies semantically relevant few-shot examples, and the multi-agent system models coordinated scoring behaviour. Our best configuration achieves an NDCG@5 of 0.71818 on the restricted validation split. We further demonstrate that PRISM is feasible and robust for production-scale financial retrieval. Its modular, inference-only design makes it practical for real-world use cases. The source code is released at https://bit.ly/prism-ailens.",针对金融长文信息检索，提出了 PRISM 框架。该免训练框架集成了精炼系统提示、上下文学习（ICL）和轻量级多智能体系统。通过提示工程提供指令，ICL 提供少样本示例，多智能体协调评分。在 FinAgentBench 验证集上，NDCG@5 达到 0.71818，证明了其在生产级金融检索中的可行性与鲁棒性。
2511.14120,Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning Framework with Vision-Language Models,"Pedestrian-vehicle incidents remain a critical urban safety challenge, with pedestrians accounting for over 20% of global traffic fatalities. Although existing video-based systems can detect when incidents occur, they provide little insight into how these events unfold across the distinct cognitive phases of pedestrian behavior. Recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for video understanding, but they remain limited in that they typically process videos in isolation, without explicit temporal structuring or multi-view integration. This paper introduces Multi-view Phase-aware Pedestrian-Vehicle Incident Reasoning (MP-PVIR), a unified framework that systematically processes multi-view video streams into structured diagnostic reports through four stages: (1) event-triggered multi-view video acquisition, (2) pedestrian behavior phase segmentation, (3) phase-specific multi-view reasoning, and (4) hierarchical synthesis and diagnostic reasoning. The framework operationalizes behavioral theory by automatically segmenting incidents into cognitive phases, performing synchronized multi-view analysis within each phase, and synthesizing results into causal chains with targeted prevention strategies. Particularly, two specialized VLMs underpin the MP-PVIR pipeline: TG-VLM for behavioral phase segmentation (mIoU = 0.4881) and PhaVR-VLM for phase-aware multi-view analysis, achieving a captioning score of 33.063 and up to 64.70% accuracy on question answering. Finally, a designated large language model is used to generate comprehensive reports detailing scene understanding, behavior interpretation, causal reasoning, and prevention recommendations. Evaluation on the Woven Traffic Safety dataset shows that MP-PVIR effectively translates multi-view video data into actionable insights, advancing AI-driven traffic safety analytics for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative systems.",针对行人-车辆事故分析，提出了 MP-PVIR 多视图阶段感知推理框架。该框架包含事件触发采集、行为阶段分割、阶段特定推理和分层诊断四个步骤。利用 TG-VLM 进行行为阶段分割（mIoU 0.4881）和 PhaVR-VLM 进行多视图分析，最终通过 LLM 生成包含场景理解、因果推理和预防建议的结构化报告。在 Woven Traffic Safety 数据集上的验证表明，该方法能有效转化多视图视频为可操作的安全见解。
2511.14119,Real-Time Mobile Video Analytics for Pre-arrival Emergency Medical Services,"Timely and accurate pre-arrival video streaming and analytics are critical for emergency medical services (EMS) to deliver life-saving interventions. Yet, current-generation EMS infrastructure remains constrained by one-to-one video streaming and limited analytics capabilities, leaving dispatchers and EMTs to manually interpret overwhelming, often noisy or redundant information in high-stress environments. We present TeleEMS, a mobile live video analytics system that enables pre-arrival multimodal inference by fusing audio and video into a unified decision-making pipeline before EMTs arrive on scene.   TeleEMS comprises two key components: TeleEMS Client and TeleEMS Server. The TeleEMS Client runs across phones, smart glasses, and desktops to support bystanders, EMTs en route, and 911 dispatchers. The TeleEMS Server, deployed at the edge, integrates EMS-Stream, a communication backbone that enables smooth multi-party video streaming. On top of EMSStream, the server hosts three real-time analytics modules: (1) audio-to-symptom analytics via EMSLlama, a domain-specialized LLM for robust symptom extraction and normalization; (2) video-to-vital analytics using state-of-the-art rPPG methods for heart rate estimation; and (3) joint text-vital analytics via PreNet, a multimodal multitask model predicting EMS protocols, medication types, medication quantities, and procedures.   Evaluation shows that EMSLlama outperforms GPT-4o (exact-match 0.89 vs. 0.57) and that text-vital fusion improves inference robustness, enabling reliable pre-arrival intervention recommendations. TeleEMS demonstrates the potential of mobile live video analytics to transform EMS operations, bridging the gap between bystanders, dispatchers, and EMTs, and paving the way for next-generation intelligent EMS infrastructure.",提出了 TeleEMS，一种用于紧急医疗服务（EMS）到达前实时视频分析的移动系统。该系统包含客户端（支持手机/眼镜）和边缘服务器，集成多方视频流传输。核心分析模块包括：EMSLlama（专用 LLM 提取症状，精确匹配率 0.89 优于 GPT-4o）、rPPG 视频生命体征检测，以及 PreNet（多模态模型融合文本与体征预测医疗方案）。实验证明，文本-体征融合增强了推理鲁棒性，为到达前干预提供了可靠支持。
2511.14117,Soft-Label Training Preserves Epistemic Uncertainty,"Many machine learning tasks involve inherent subjectivity, where annotators naturally provide varied labels. Standard practice collapses these label distributions into single labels, aggregating diverse human judgments into point estimates. We argue that this approach is epistemically misaligned for ambiguous data--the annotation distribution itself should be regarded as the ground truth. Training on collapsed single labels forces models to express false confidence on fundamentally ambiguous cases, creating a misalignment between model certainty and the diversity of human perception. We demonstrate empirically that soft-label training, which treats annotation distributions as ground truth, preserves epistemic uncertainty. Across both vision and NLP tasks, soft-label training achieves 32% lower KL divergence from human annotations and 61% stronger correlation between model and annotation entropy, while matching the accuracy of hard-label training. Our work repositions annotation distributions from noisy signals to be aggregated away, to faithful representations of epistemic uncertainty that models should learn to reproduce.",针对具有主观性和歧义性的数据，标准硬标签（hard-label）训练强制模型表达虚假自信，忽略了认知的多义性。本文提出将标注分布本身视为基本真值的软标签（soft-label）训练，以保留认知不确定性。在视觉和 NLP 任务上的实验表明，软标签训练在保持准确率的同时，与人类标注的 KL 散度降低了 32%，熵相关性提升了 61%，有效对齐了模型确定性与人类感知的多样性。
2511.14112,Synthetic Clinical Notes for Rare ICD Codes: A Data-Centric Framework for Long-Tail Medical Coding,"Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction.",针对医疗 ICD 编码中长尾分布导致的稀有代码识别难题，提出了一种以数据为中心的合成框架。该方法利用真实共现模式、ICD 描述及类似病例构建提示，生成了 9 万份涵盖 7902 个 ICD 代码的高质量合成出院小结。在扩展数据集上微调 PLM-ICD 和 GKI-ICD 模型，实验显示该方法在保持 strong micro-F1 的同时提升了 macro-F1，优于现有 SOTA，证明了精心设计的合成数据在改善长尾预测公平性方面的价值。
2511.14111,CascadedViT: Cascaded Chunk-FeedForward and Cascaded Group Attention Vision Transformer,"Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a range of computer vision tasks; however, their high computational, memory, and energy demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose \emph{Cascaded-ViT (CViT)}, a lightweight and compute-efficient vision transformer architecture featuring a novel feedforward network design called \emph{Cascaded-Chunk Feed Forward Network (CCFFN)}. By splitting input features, CCFFN improves parameter and FLOP efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that our \emph{CViT-XL} model achieves 75.5\% Top-1 accuracy while reducing FLOPs by 15\% and energy consumption by 3.3\% compared to EfficientViT-M5. Across various model sizes, the CViT family consistently exhibits the lowest energy consumption, making it suitable for deployment on battery-constrained devices such as mobile phones and drones. Furthermore, when evaluated using a new metric called \emph{Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF)}, which quantifies compute efficiency relative to accuracy, CViT models consistently achieve top-ranking efficiency. Particularly, CViT-L is 2.2\% more accurate than EfficientViT-M2 while having comparable APF scores.",针对 Vision Transformer 的高计算和能耗问题，提出了 Cascaded-ViT (CViT) 轻量级架构。核心设计为级联块前馈网络（CCFFN）和级联组注意力，通过特征分割提升效率。在 ImageNet-1K 上，CViT-XL 达到 75.5% Top-1 准确率，较 EfficientViT-M5 减少 15% FLOPs 和 3.3% 能耗。引入 Accuracy-Per-FLOP (APF) 指标评估，CViT 系列表现出优异的计算效率，适合移动设备部署。
2511.14101,APD-Agents: A Large Language Model-Driven Multi-Agents Collaborative Framework for Automated Page Design,"Layout design is a crucial step in developing mobile app pages. However, crafting satisfactory designs is time-intensive for designers: they need to consider which controls and content to present on the page, and then repeatedly adjust their size, position, and style for better aesthetics and structure. Although many design software can now help to perform these repetitive tasks, extensive training is needed to use them effectively. Moreover, collaborative design across app pages demands extra time to align standards and ensure consistent styling. In this work, we propose APD-agents, a large language model (LLM) driven multi-agent framework for automated page design in mobile applications. Our framework contains OrchestratorAgent, SemanticParserAgent, PrimaryLayoutAgent, TemplateRetrievalAgent, and RecursiveComponentAgent. Upon receiving the user's description of the page, the OrchestratorAgent can dynamically can direct other agents to accomplish users' design task. To be specific, the SemanticParserAgent is responsible for converting users' descriptions of page content into structured data. The PrimaryLayoutAgent can generate an initial coarse-grained layout of this page. The TemplateRetrievalAgent can fetch semantically relevant few-shot examples and enhance the quality of layout generation. Besides, a RecursiveComponentAgent can be used to decide how to recursively generate all the fine-grained sub-elements it contains for each element in the layout. Our work fully leverages the automatic collaboration capabilities of large-model-driven multi-agent systems. Experimental results on the RICO dataset show that our APD-agents achieve state-of-the-art performance.",针对移动应用页面设计耗时且需反复调整的问题，提出了基于 LLM 的多智能体协作框架 APD-agents。该框架包含编排、语义解析、初级布局、模板检索和递归组件等 5 类智能体，分别负责任务调度、内容结构化、粗粒度布局生成、范例检索增强和细粒度子元素递归生成。在 RICO 数据集上的实验表明，该自动化协作设计方案达到了 SOTA 性能，有效提升了设计效率。
2511.14099,FAPE-IR: Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution Framework for All-in-One Image Restoration,"All-in-One Image Restoration (AIO-IR) aims to develop a unified model that can handle multiple degradations under complex conditions. However, existing methods often rely on task-specific designs or latent routing strategies, making it hard to adapt to real-world scenarios with various degradations. We propose FAPE-IR, a Frequency-Aware Planning and Execution framework for image restoration. It uses a frozen Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) as a planner to analyze degraded images and generate concise, frequency-aware restoration plans. These plans guide a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts (LoRA-MoE) module within a diffusion-based executor, which dynamically selects high- or low-frequency experts, complemented by frequency features of the input image. To further improve restoration quality and reduce artifacts, we introduce adversarial training and a frequency regularization loss. By coupling semantic planning with frequency-based restoration, FAPE-IR offers a unified and interpretable solution for all-in-one image restoration. Extensive experiments show that FAPE-IR achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven restoration tasks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization under mixed degradations.",针对一体化图像恢复（AIO-IR）中多种退化难以自适应处理的问题，提出了 FAPE-IR 频率感知规划执行框架。该方法利用冻结的 MLLM 分析图像并生成频率感知恢复计划，指导基于扩散的执行器中的 LoRA-MoE 模块动态选择高/低频专家。结合对抗训练和频率正则化损失，FAPE-IR 在 7 项恢复任务中达到 SOTA，并在混合退化场景下展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。
2511.14098,"Collaborative QA using Interacting LLMs. Impact of Network Structure, Node Capability and Distributed Data","In this paper, we model and analyze how a network of interacting LLMs performs collaborative question-answering (CQA) in order to estimate a ground truth given a distributed set of documents. This problem is interesting because LLMs often hallucinate when direct evidence to answer a question is lacking, and these effects become more pronounced in a network of interacting LLMs. The hallucination spreads, causing previously accurate LLMs to hallucinate. We study interacting LLMs and their hallucination by combining novel ideas of mean-field dynamics (MFD) from network science and the randomized utility model from economics to construct a useful generative model. We model the LLM with a latent state that indicates if it is truthful or not with respect to the ground truth, and extend a tractable analytical model considering an MFD to model the diffusion of information in a directed network of LLMs. To specify the probabilities that govern the dynamics of the MFD, we propose a randomized utility model. For a network of LLMs, where each LLM has two possible latent states, we posit sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a fixed point and analyze the behavior of the fixed point in terms of the incentive (e.g., test-time compute) given to individual LLMs. We experimentally study and analyze the behavior of a network of $100$ open-source LLMs with respect to data heterogeneity, node capability, network structure, and sensitivity to framing on multiple semi-synthetic datasets.",针对分布式文档下的协作问答（CQA）任务，本文建模分析了交互式 LLM 网络中的信息传播与幻觉扩散。结合网络科学的平均场动力学（MFD）和经济学的随机效用模型，构建了生成模型来描述 LLM 的潜在真实性状态。研究推导了固定点存在和唯一的充分条件，并分析了激励（如推理计算量）对系统行为的影响。在 100 个开源 LLM 组成的网络上的实验揭示了数据异质性、节点能力及网络结构对协作效果的影响。
2511.14096,NeuroPath: Neurobiology-Inspired Path Tracking and Reflection for Semantically Coherent Retrieval,"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) greatly enhances large language models (LLMs) performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, naive RAG methods struggle with multi-hop question answering due to their limited capacity to capture complex dependencies across documents. Recent studies employ graph-based RAG to capture document connections. However, these approaches often result in a loss of semantic coherence and introduce irrelevant noise during node matching and subgraph construction. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroPath, an LLM-driven semantic path tracking RAG framework inspired by the path navigational planning of place cells in neurobiology. It consists of two steps: Dynamic Path Tracking and Post-retrieval Completion. Dynamic Path Tracking performs goal-directed semantic path tracking and pruning over the constructed knowledge graph (KG), improving noise reduction and semantic coherence. Post-retrieval Completion further reinforces these benefits by conducting second-stage retrieval using intermediate reasoning and the original query to refine the query goal and complete missing information in the reasoning path. NeuroPath surpasses current state-of-the-art baselines on three multi-hop QA datasets, achieving average improvements of 16.3% on recall@2 and 13.5% on recall@5 over advanced graph-based RAG methods. Moreover, compared to existing iter-based RAG methods, NeuroPath achieves higher accuracy and reduces token consumption by 22.8%. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of NeuroPath across four smaller LLMs (Llama3.1, GLM4, Mistral0.3, and Gemma3), and further validate its scalability across tasks of varying complexity. Code is available at https://github.com/KennyCaty/NeuroPath.",针对 Graph-based RAG 在多跳问答中语义连贯性差和噪声高的问题，受神经生物学位置细胞路径规划启发，提出了 NeuroPath 框架。该方法包含动态路径追踪（在知识图谱上进行目标导向的修剪与追踪）和检索后补全（二次检索补充缺失信息）。在三个多跳 QA 数据集上，NeuroPath 的 recall@2 和 recall@5 分别提升 16.3% 和 13.5%，Token 消耗减少 22.8%，且在多个小模型上展现了鲁棒性和可扩展性。
2511.14087,GCA-ResUNet:Image segmentation in medical images using grouped coordinate attention,"Medical image segmentation underpins computer-aided diagnosis and therapy by supporting clinical diagnosis, preoperative planning, and disease monitoring. While U-Net style convolutional neural networks perform well due to their encoder-decoder structures with skip connections, they struggle to capture long-range dependencies. Transformer-based variants address global context but often require heavy computation and large training datasets. This paper proposes GCA-ResUNet, an efficient segmentation network that integrates Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) into ResNet-50 residual blocks. GCA uses grouped coordinate modeling to jointly encode global dependencies across channels and spatial locations, strengthening feature representation and boundary delineation while adding minimal parameter and FLOP overhead compared with self-attention. On the Synapse dataset, GCA-ResUNet achieves a Dice score of 86.11%, and on the ACDC dataset, it reaches 92.64%, surpassing several state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining fast inference and favorable computational efficiency. These results indicate that GCA offers a practical way to enhance convolutional architectures with global modeling capability, enabling high-accuracy and resource-efficient medical image segmentation.",针对 U-Net 难以捕捉长程依赖及 Transformer 计算重的问题，提出了 GCA-ResUNet。该网络在 ResNet-50 残差块中集成当分组坐标注意力（GCA），通过联合编码通道和空间位置的全局依赖，增强特征表示和边界描绘，且参数量增加极少。在 Synapse 和 ACDC 数据集上，Dice 分数分别达到 86.11% 和 92.64%，以高效的计算成本优于多个 SOTA 基线。
2511.14086,Error-Driven Scene Editing for 3D Grounding in Large Language Models,"Despite recent progress in 3D-LLMs, they remain limited in accurately grounding language to visual and spatial elements in 3D environments. This limitation stems in part from training data that focuses on language reasoning rather than spatial understanding due to scarce 3D resources, leaving inherent grounding biases unresolved. To address this, we propose 3D scene editing as a key mechanism to generate precise visual counterfactuals that mitigate these biases through fine-grained spatial manipulation, without requiring costly scene reconstruction or large-scale 3D data collection. Furthermore, to make these edits targeted and directly address the specific weaknesses of the model, we introduce DEER-3D, an error-driven framework following a structured ""Decompose, Diagnostic Evaluation, Edit, and Re-train"" workflow, rather than broadly or randomly augmenting data as in conventional approaches. Specifically, upon identifying a grounding failure of the 3D-LLM, our framework first diagnoses the exact predicate-level error (e.g., attribute or spatial relation). It then executes minimal, predicate-aligned 3D scene edits, such as recoloring or repositioning, to produce targeted counterfactual supervision for iterative model fine-tuning, significantly enhancing grounding accuracy. We evaluate our editing pipeline across multiple benchmarks for 3D grounding and scene understanding tasks, consistently demonstrating improvements across all evaluated datasets through iterative refinement. DEER-3D underscores the effectiveness of targeted, error-driven scene editing in bridging linguistic reasoning capabilities with spatial grounding in 3D LLMs.",针对 3D-LLM 空间接地能力不足的问题，提出了 DEER-3D 框架。该方法采用“分解-诊断-编辑-重训”的工作流，通过诊断模型在谓词级（属性或空间关系）的接地错误，执行有针对性的 3D 场景编辑（如重新着色、重定位）生成视觉反事实数据。利用这些精细化数据进行迭代微调，显著提升了模型在多个基准测试中的 3D 接地准确性，证明了错误驱动的定向场景编辑在弥合语言推理与空间感知差距方面的有效性。
2511.14083,Automated glenoid bone loss measurement and segmentation in CT scans for pre-operative planning in shoulder instability,"Reliable measurement of glenoid bone loss is essential for operative planning in shoulder instability, but current manual and semi-automated methods are time-consuming and often subject to interreader variability. We developed and validated a fully automated deep learning pipeline for measuring glenoid bone loss on three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans using a linear-based, en-face view, best-circle method. Shoulder CT images of 91 patients (average age, 40 years; range, 14-89 years; 65 men) were retrospectively collected along with manual labels including glenoid segmentation, landmarks, and bone loss measurements. The multi-stage algorithm has three main stages: (1) segmentation, where we developed a U-Net to automatically segment the glenoid and humerus; (2) anatomical landmark detection, where a second network predicts glenoid rim points; and (3) geometric fitting, where we applied principal component analysis (PCA), projection, and circle fitting to compute the percentage of bone loss. The automated measurements showed strong agreement with consensus readings and exceeded surgeon-to-surgeon consistency (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.84 vs 0.78), including in low- and high-bone-loss subgroups (ICC 0.71 vs 0.63 and 0.83 vs 0.21, respectively; P < 0.001). For classifying patients into low, medium, and high bone-loss categories, the pipeline achieved a recall of 0.714 for low and 0.857 for high severity, with no low cases misclassified as high or vice versa. These results suggest that our method is a time-efficient and clinically reliable tool for preoperative planning in shoulder instability and for screening patients with substantial glenoid bone loss. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Edenliu1/Auto-Glenoid-Measurement-DL-Pipeline.",针对肩关节不稳术前规划中关节盂骨缺损测量耗时且变异大的问题，开发了全自动深度学习流水线。该方法包含 U-Net 分割、解剖标志点检测及基于 PCA 和圆拟合的几何计算三阶段。在 91 例 CT 数据上的验证显示，自动化测量与共识读数的一致性（ICC 0.84）优于外科医生间的一致性（0.78），且在严重程度分类上表现出高召回率，为临床提供了一种高效可靠的术前规划工具。
2511.14082,Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis for Few-Shot Medical Image Classification,"Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis but are fundamentally constrained by the requirement for large-scale, meticulously annotated datasets. This dependency on ""big data"" is a critical bottleneck in the medical domain, where patient data is inherently difficult to acquire and expert annotation is expensive, particularly for rare diseases where samples are scarce by definition. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel paradigm: Zero-Training Task-Specific Model Synthesis (ZS-TMS). Instead of adapting a pre-existing model or training a new one, our approach leverages a large-scale, pre-trained generative engine to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier. Our framework, the Semantic-Guided Parameter Synthesizer (SGPS), takes as input minimal, multi-modal task information as little as a single example image (1-shot) and a corresponding clinical text description to directly synthesize the entire set of parameters for a task-specific classifier.   The generative engine interprets these inputs to generate the weights for a lightweight, efficient classifier (e.g., an EfficientNet-V2), which can be deployed for inference immediately without any task-specific training or fine-tuning. We conduct extensive evaluations on challenging few-shot classification benchmarks derived from the ISIC 2018 skin lesion dataset and a custom rare disease dataset. Our results demonstrate that SGPS establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming advanced few-shot and zero-shot learning methods, especially in the ultra-low data regimes of 1-shot and 5-shot classification. This work paves the way for the rapid development and deployment of AI-powered diagnostic tools, particularly for the long tail of rare diseases where data is critically limited.",针对医学图像尤其是罕见病数据稀缺的挑战，提出了零训练任务特定模型合成（ZS-TMS）范式。通过语义引导参数合成器（SGPS），仅需单张图像（1-shot）和临床文本描述，即可利用生成引擎直接合成轻量级分类器（如 EfficientNet-V2）的全部参数，无需微调即可推理。在皮肤病变和罕见病数据集上的评估表明，SGPS 在极低数据量下显著优于现有的少样本和零样本学习方法，为长尾疾病诊断提供了快速部署方案。
2511.14075,CFG-EC: Error Correction Classifier-Free Guidance,"Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become a mainstream approach for simultaneously improving prompt fidelity and generation quality in conditional generative models. During training, CFG stochastically alternates between conditional and null prompts to enable both conditional and unconditional generation. However, during sampling, CFG outputs both null and conditional prompts simultaneously, leading to inconsistent noise estimates between the training and sampling processes. To reduce this error, we propose CFG-EC, a versatile correction scheme augmentable to any CFG-based method by refining the unconditional noise predictions. CFG-EC actively realigns the unconditional noise error component to be orthogonal to the conditional error component. This corrective maneuver prevents interference between the two guidance components, thereby constraining the sampling error's upper bound and establishing more reliable guidance trajectories for high-fidelity image generation. Our numerical experiments show that CFG-EC handles the unconditional component more effectively than CFG and CFG++, delivering a marked performance increase in the low guidance sampling regime and consistently higher prompt alignment across the board.",针对 CFG 采样过程中条件与无条件噪声估计不一致导致的误差，提出了 CFG-EC 修正方案。通过将无条件噪声误差分量调整为与条件误差分量正交，防止两者干扰，从而约束采样误差上限并确立更可靠的引导轨迹。实验表明，CFG-EC 在低引导采样及 Prompt 对齐方面均优于 CFG 和 CFG++。
2511.14064,CafeMed: Causal Attention Fusion Enhanced Medication Recommendation,"Medication recommendation systems play a crucial role in assisting clinicians with personalized treatment decisions. While existing approaches have made significant progress in learning medication representations, they suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) treating medical entities as independent features without modeling their synergistic effects on medication selection; (ii) employing static causal relationships that fail to adapt to patient-specific contexts and health states. To address these challenges, we propose CafeMed, a framework that integrates dynamic causal reasoning with cross-modal attention for safe and accurate medication recommendation. CafeMed introduces two key components: the Causal Weight Generator (CWG) that transforms static causal effects into dynamic modulation weights based on individual patient states, and the Channel Harmonized Attention Refinement Module (CHARM) that captures complex interdependencies between diagnoses and procedures. This design enables CafeMed to model how different medical conditions jointly influence treatment decisions while maintaining medication safety constraints. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that CafeMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior accuracy in medication prediction while maintaining the lower drug--drug interaction rates. Our results indicate that incorporating dynamic causal relationships and cross-modal synergies leads to more clinically-aligned and personalized medication recommendations. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/rkl71/CafeMed.",针对药物推荐中忽视实体协同效应和因果关系静态化的问题，提出了 CafeMed 框架。该模型结合动态因果推理与跨模态注意力，通过因果权重生成器（CWG）根据患者状态动态调整因果影响，并利用通道协调注意力细化模块（CHARM）捕捉诊断与手术间的复杂依赖。在 MIMIC-III/IV 上的实验表明，CafeMed 在提高预测准确率的同时降低了药物相互作用率，实现了更安全、个性化的推荐。
2511.14057,A Machine Learning-Based Multimodal Framework for Wearable Sensor-Based Archery Action Recognition and Stress Estimation,"In precision sports such as archery, athletes' performance depends on both biomechanical stability and psychological resilience. Traditional motion analysis systems are often expensive and intrusive, limiting their use in natural training environments. To address this limitation, we propose a machine learning-based multimodal framework that integrates wearable sensor data for simultaneous action recognition and stress estimation. Using a self-developed wrist-worn device equipped with an accelerometer and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, we collected synchronized motion and physiological data during real archery sessions. For motion recognition, we introduce a novel feature--Smoothed Differential Acceleration (SmoothDiff)--and employ a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to identify motion phases, achieving 96.8% accuracy and 95.9% F1-score. For stress estimation, we extract heart rate variability (HRV) features from PPG signals and apply a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier, achieving 80% accuracy in distinguishing high- and low-stress levels. The proposed framework demonstrates that integrating motion and physiological sensing can provide meaningful insights into athletes' technical and mental states. This approach offers a foundation for developing intelligent, real-time feedback systems for training optimization in archery and other precision sports.",针对射箭运动中动作识别与压力评估的需求，开发了一种基于穿戴式传感器的多模态机器学习框架。利用自研腕带采集加速度和 PPG 数据，提出 SmoothDiff 特征结合 LSTM 识别动作相位（准确率 96.8%），并通过 PPG 提取 HRV 特征结合 MLP 评估压力水平（准确率 80%）。该系统为精准运动训练提供了低成本、非侵入式的实时反馈方案。
2511.14056,Radial Compensation: Stable and Semantically Decoupled Generative Models on Riemannian Manifolds,"Generative models on curved spaces rely on charts to map Euclidean spaces to manifolds. Exponential maps preserve geodesics but have stiff, radius-dependent Jacobians, while volume-preserving charts maintain densities but distort geodesic distances. Both approaches entangle curvature with model parameters, inflating gradient variance. In high-dimensional latent normalizing flows, the wrapped exponential prior can stretch radii far beyond the curvature scale, leading to poor test likelihoods and stiff solvers. We introduce Radial Compensation (RC), an information-geometric method that selects the base density in the tangent space so that the likelihood depends only on geodesic distance from a pole, decoupling parameter semantics from curvature. RC lets radial parameters retain their usual meaning in geodesic units, while the chart can be tuned as a numerical preconditioner. We extend RC to manifolds with known geodesic polar volume and show that RC is the only construction for geodesic-radial likelihoods with curvature-invariant Fisher information. We derive the Balanced-Exponential (bExp) chart family, balancing volume distortion and geodesic error. Under RC, all bExp settings preserve the same manifold density and Fisher information, with smaller dial values reducing gradient variance and flow cost. Empirically, RC yields stable generative models across densities, VAEs, flows on images and graphs, and protein models. RC improves likelihoods, restores clean geodesic radii, and prevents radius blow-ups in high-dimensional flows, making RC-bExp a robust default for likelihood-trained generative models on manifolds.",针对黎曼流形生成模型中曲率与参数纠缠导致的梯度方差大及求解困难问题，提出了径向补偿（RC）方法。RC 是一种信息几何技术，通过在切空间选择基密度，使似然仅依赖于测地线距离，从而解耦参数语义与曲率。推导出了 Balanced-Exponential (bExp) 图表族，平衡体积失真与测地线误差。实验表明，RC-bExp 在图像、图和蛋白质模型的 VAE 及流模型中实现了稳定的生成，解决了高维流中的半径膨胀问题，提升了似然估计。
2511.14052,Making Evidence Actionable in Adaptive Learning,"Adaptive learning often diagnoses precisely yet intervenes weakly, yielding help that is mistimed or misaligned. This study presents evidence supporting an instructor-governed feedback loop that converts concept-level assessment evidence into vetted micro-interventions. The adaptive learning algorithm contains three safeguards: adequacy as a hard guarantee of gap closure, attention as a budgeted constraint for time and redundancy, and diversity as protection against overfitting to a single resource. We formalize intervention assignment as a binary integer program with constraints for coverage, time, difficulty windows informed by ability estimates, prerequisites encoded by a concept matrix, and anti-redundancy enforced through diversity. Greedy selection serves low-richness and tight-latency regimes, gradient-based relaxation serves rich repositories, and a hybrid method transitions along a richness-latency frontier. In simulation and in an introductory physics deployment with one thousand two hundred four students, both solvers achieved full skill coverage for essentially all learners within bounded watch time. The gradient-based method reduced redundant coverage by approximately twelve percentage points relative to greedy and harmonized difficulty across slates, while greedy delivered comparable adequacy with lower computational cost in scarce settings. Slack variables localized missing content and supported targeted curation, sustaining sufficiency across subgroups. The result is a tractable and auditable controller that closes the diagnostic-pedagogical loop and delivers equitable, load-aware personalization at classroom scale.",针对自适应学习干预不及时或不匹配的问题，提出了一种将评估证据转化为微干预的反馈循环机制。算法集成了充分性、注意力预算和多样性三重保障，将干预分配形式化为二元整数规划问题。在 1204 名学生的物理课程实验中，贪婪算法和基于梯度的松弛算法均在有限时间内实现了技能全覆盖。基于梯度的方法减少了 12% 的冗余覆盖并平衡了难度，而贪婪方法在资源稀缺场景下更高效。该系统为大规模课堂提供了可审计、负载感知的个性化学习方案。
2511.14045,GRPO Privacy Is at Risk: A Membership Inference Attack Against Reinforcement Learning With Verifiable Rewards,"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on large language models (LLMs) pose significant privacy risks across various stages of model training. Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have brought a profound paradigm shift in LLM training, particularly for complex reasoning tasks. However, the on-policy nature of RLVR introduces a unique privacy leakage pattern: since training relies on self-generated responses without fixed ground-truth outputs, membership inference must now determine whether a given prompt (independent of any specific response) is used during fine-tuning. This creates a threat where leakage arises not from answer memorization.   To audit this novel privacy risk, we propose Divergence-in-Behavior Attack (DIBA), the first membership inference framework specifically designed for RLVR. DIBA shifts the focus from memorization to behavioral change, leveraging measurable shifts in model behavior across two axes: advantage-side improvement (e.g., correctness gain) and logit-side divergence (e.g., policy drift). Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate that DIBA significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving around 0.8 AUC and an order-of-magnitude higher TPR@0.1%FPR. We validate DIBA's superiority across multiple settings--including in-distribution, cross-dataset, cross-algorithm, black-box scenarios, and extensions to vision-language models. Furthermore, our attack remains robust under moderate defensive measures.   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically analyze privacy vulnerabilities in RLVR, revealing that even in the absence of explicit supervision, training data exposure can be reliably inferred through behavioral traces.",针对可验证奖励强化学习（RLVR）中独特的隐私泄露风险，提出了首个成员推断攻击框架 DIBA。由于 RLVR 依赖自生成响应，DIBA 将攻击焦点从记忆化转向行为变化，利用优势侧改进（正确性增益）和 Logit 侧发散（策略漂移）两个维度的指标。实验显示，DIBA 在多场景下 AUC 达 0.8，TPR@0.1%FPR 提升了一个数量级，揭示了 RLVR 即使无显式监督也会通过行为痕迹泄露训练数据的严重隐患。
2511.14043,"AISAC: An Integrated multi-agent System for Transparent, Retrieval-Grounded Scientific Assistance","AI Scientific Assistant Core (AISAC) is an integrated multi-agent system developed at Argonne National Laboratory for scientific and engineering workflows. AISAC builds on established technologies - LangGraph for orchestration, FAISS for vector search, and SQLite for persistence - and integrates them into a unified system prototype focused on transparency, provenance tracking, and scientific adaptability.   The system implements a Router-Planner-Coordinator workflow and an optional Evaluator role, using prompt-engineered agents coordinated via LangGraph's StateGraph and supported by helper agents such as a Researcher.

2511.14030,Training-free Detection of AI-generated images via Cropping Robustness,"AI-generated image detection has become crucial with the rapid advancement of vision-generative models. Instead of training detectors tailored to specific datasets, we study a training-free approach leveraging self-supervised models without requiring prior data knowledge. These models, pre-trained with augmentations like RandomResizedCrop, learn to produce consistent representations across varying resolutions. Motivated by this, we propose WaRPAD, a training-free AI-generated image detection algorithm based on self-supervised models. Since neighborhood pixel differences in images are highly sensitive to resizing operations, WaRPAD first defines a base score function that quantifies the sensitivity of image embeddings to perturbations along high-frequency directions extracted via Haar wavelet decomposition. To simulate robustness against cropping augmentation, we rescale each image to a multiple of the models input size, divide it into smaller patches, and compute the base score for each patch. The final detection score is then obtained by averaging the scores across all patches. We validate WaRPAD on real datasets of diverse resolutions and domains, and images generated by 23 different generative models. Our method consistently achieves competitive performance and demonstrates strong robustness to test-time corruptions. Furthermore, as invariance to RandomResizedCrop is a common training scheme across self-supervised models, we show that WaRPAD is applicable across self-supervised models.",针对 AI 生成图像检测，提出了一种基于自监督模型的免训练算法 WaRPAD。利用自监督模型对裁剪增强的不变性，WaRPAD 通过 Haar 小波分解提取高频扰动，量化图像嵌入的敏感度。通过多尺度 Patch 评分平均，该方法有效区分生成图像与真实图像。在 23 种生成模型上的验证显示，WaRPAD 具有竞争力的性能和对测试时破坏的强鲁棒性。
2511.14023,Syn-STARTS: Synthesized START Triage Scenario Generation Framework for Scalable LLM Evaluation,"Triage is a critically important decision-making process in mass casualty incidents (MCIs) to maximize victim survival rates. While the role of AI in such situations is gaining attention for making optimal decisions within limited resources and time, its development and performance evaluation require benchmark datasets of sufficient quantity and quality. However, MCIs occur infrequently, and sufficient records are difficult to accumulate at the scene, making it challenging to collect large-scale realworld data for research use. Therefore, we developed Syn-STARTS, a framework that uses LLMs to generate triage cases, and verified its effectiveness. The results showed that the triage cases generated by Syn-STARTS were qualitatively indistinguishable from the TRIAGE open dataset generated by manual curation from training materials. Furthermore, when evaluating the LLM accuracy using hundreds of cases each from the green, yellow, red, and black categories defined by the standard triage method START, the results were found to be highly stable. This strongly indicates the possibility of synthetic data in developing high-performance AI models for severe and critical medical situations.",针对大规模伤亡事件（MCI）中分诊数据稀缺的问题，开发了 Syn-STARTS 框架，利用 LLM 生成符合 START 标准的合成检伤分类案例。验证表明，合成案例质量与人工策划数据集无异，且在四种分诊类别（绿/黄/红/黑）的 LLM 评估中表现高度稳定。该研究证实了合成数据在开发高性能急救 AI 模型中的可行性。
2511.14022,"Keeping Code-Aware LLMs Fresh: Full Refresh, In-Context Deltas, and Incremental Fine-Tuning","Modern codebases evolve continuously: files are renamed or deleted; public APIs drift; behavior shifts within otherwise familiar modules. A model trained yesterday to map a developer's natural-language question to the exact set of repository file paths that matter will degrade tomorrow, even if the questions themselves look unchanged. In this paper we study, at system scale and across several widely used repositories, how to keep such a model fresh without surrendering retention on earlier code. We frame freshness as a form of domain drift between a base snapshot and the current HEAD, and we compare three families of update strategies: (A) Full Refresh, retraining the entire model at the new snapshot; (B) In-Context Learning (ICL) that injects recent deltas (raw git diffs or concise English summaries) at inference; and (C) Incremental Fine-Tuning (Inc-FT) on delta-derived training sets, with carefully controlled NEW:OLD mixing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We contribute an alias-aware evaluation protocol that credits rename while never rewarding deleted paths, and a practical Forgetting Probe that quantifies residual emissions of obsolete paths. Across Flask, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Poetry, Inc-FT with old-aware mixes delivers the best overall balance on mixed sets, ICL with English delta summaries delivers the fastest new-code lift when training is not feasible, and Full Refresh remains the ceiling when maximum NEW accuracy matters. We also compare Git-diff Inc-FT to full-file Inc-FT, showing that diffs excel in rename/delete-heavy windows while full-file context wins in behavior-change-heavy windows.",针对代码库快速演进导致的 LLM 知识过时问题，比较了全量刷新（Full Refresh）、上下文增量（ICL with Deltas）和增量微调（Inc-FT）三种更新策略。引入了别名感知评估协议和遗忘探针。在 Flask、Pandas 等库上的实验表明：混合旧数据的 Inc-FT 在综合性能上最佳；基于英语摘要 Delta 的 ICL 在无法训练时提升最快；Full Refresh 仍是新代码准确率的上限。此外，Git-diff 微调适用于重命名/删除场景，而全文件微调在行为变更场景下更优。
2511.14021,MRI Plane Orientation Detection using a Context-Aware 2.5D Model,"Humans can easily identify anatomical planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal) on a 2D MRI slice, but automated systems struggle with this task. Missing plane orientation metadata can complicate analysis, increase domain shift when merging heterogeneous datasets, and reduce accuracy of diagnostic classifiers. This study develops a classifier that accurately generates plane orientation metadata. We adopt a 2.5D context-aware model that leverages multi-slice information to avoid ambiguity from isolated slices and enable robust feature learning. We train the 2.5D model on both 3D slice sequences and static 2D images. While our 2D reference model achieves 98.74% accuracy, our 2.5D method raises this to 99.49%, reducing errors by 60%, highlighting the importance of 2.5D context. We validate the utility of our generated metadata in a brain tumor detection task. A gated strategy selectively uses metadata-enhanced predictions based on uncertainty scores, boosting accuracy from 97.0% with an image-only model to 98.0%, reducing misdiagnoses by 33.3%.

2511.14018,ALEX:A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor,"The static nature of knowledge within Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult for them to adapt to evolving information, rendering knowledge editing a critical task. However, existing methods struggle with challenges of scalability and retrieval efficiency, particularly when handling complex, multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ALEX (A Light Editing-knowledge Extractor), a lightweight knowledge editing framework. The core innovation of ALEX is its hierarchical memory architecture, which organizes knowledge updates (edits) into semantic clusters. This design fundamentally reduces retrieval complexity from a linear O(N) to a highly scalable O(K+N/C). Furthermore, the framework integrates an Inferential Query Synthesis (IQS) module to bridge the semantic gap between queries and facts , and a Dynamic Evidence Adjudication (DEA) engine that executes an efficient two-stage retrieval process. Experiments on the MQUAKE benchmark demonstrate that ALEX significantly improves both the accuracy of multi-hop answers (MultiHop-ACC) and the reliability of reasoning paths (HopWise-ACC). It also reduces the required search space by over 80% , presenting a promising path toward building scalable, efficient, and accurate knowledge editing systems.",针对 LLM 知识编辑中的可扩展性和多跳推理难题，提出了轻量级框架 ALEX。其核心创新包括分层记忆架构（将编辑组织为语义簇，检索复杂度降至 $O(K+N/C)$）、推理查询合成（IQS）模块（弥合查询与事实差距）及动态证据裁决（DEA）引擎（两阶段检索）。在 MQUAKE 基准测试中，ALEX 显著提升了多跳回答准确率和推理路径可靠性，同时减少了 80% 以上的搜索空间。
2511.14017,"From Narrow Unlearning to Emergent Misalignment: Causes, Consequences, and Containment in LLMs","Recent work has shown that fine-tuning on insecure code data can trigger an emergent misalignment (EMA) phenomenon, where models generate malicious responses even to prompts unrelated to the original insecure code-writing task. Such cross-domain generalization of harmful behavior underscores the need for a deeper understanding of the algorithms, tasks, and datasets that induce emergent misalignment. In this work, we extend this study by demonstrating that emergent misalignment can also arise from narrow refusal unlearning in specific domains. We perform refusal unlearning on Cybersecurity and Safety concept, and evaluate EMA by monitoring refusal scores across seven responsible AI (RAI) domains, Cybersecurity, Safety, Toxicity, Bias, Sensitive Content, Medical/Legal, and Privacy. Our work shows that narrow domain unlearning can yield compliance responses for the targeted concept, however, it may also propagate EMA to unrelated domains. Among the two intervened concepts, Cybersecurity and Safety, we find that the safety concept can have larger EMA impact, i.e, causing lower refusal scores, across other unrelated domains such as bias. We observe this effect consistently across two model families, Mistral-7b-0.3v, and Qwen-7b-2.5. Further, we show that refusal unlearning augmented with cross-entropy loss function on a small set of retain data from the affected domains can largely, if not fully, restore alignment across the impacted domains while having lower refusal rate on the concept we perform unlearning on. To investigate the underlying causes of EMA, we analyze concept entanglements at the representation level via concept vectors. Our analysis reveals that concepts with higher representation similarity in earlier layers are more susceptible to EMA after intervention when the refusal stream is altered through targeted refusal unlearning.",研究发现针对特定领域（如网络安全、安全概念）的狭窄拒绝遗忘（Refusal Unlearning）会导致涌现性错位（Emergent Misalignment, EMA），即模型在未干预领域（如偏见）的拒绝能力下降。在 Mistral 和 Qwen 模型上的实验表明，安全概念的遗忘比网络安全概念更容易引发广泛的 EMA。通过概念向量分析发现，早期层中表示相似度高的概念更易受 EMA 影响。提出利用少量保留数据的交叉熵损失增强遗忘过程，可有效缓解 EMA 并恢复对齐。

The paper examines the behavior of artificial intelligence (AI) from engineering points of view to clarify its nature and limits. The paper argues that the rationality underlying humanity's impulse to pursue, articulate, and adhere to rules deserves to be valued and preserved. Identifying where rule-based practical rationality ends is the beginning of making it aware until action. Although the rules of AI behaviors are still hidden or only weakly observable, the paper has proposed a methodology to make a sense of discrimination possible and practical to identify the distinctions of the behavior of AI models with three types of decisions. It is a prerequisite for human responsibilities with alternative possibilities, considering how and when to use AI. It would be a solid start for people to ensure AI system soundness for the well-being of humans, society, and the environment.",本文从工程角度审视 AI 行为，探讨其与基于规则软件的根本区别。文章主张保护人类追求规则理性的价值，并指出 AI 行为规则虽隐蔽，但可通过所提出的方法论对三种决策类型的 AI 行为进行辨析。这是界定人类责任、确保 AI 系统健全性及造福人类社会的前提。
2511.14010,Knowledge-Grounded Agentic Large Language Models for Multi-Hazard Understanding from Reconnaissance Reports,"Post-disaster reconnaissance reports contain critical evidence for understanding multi-hazard interactions, yet their unstructured narratives make systematic knowledge transfer difficult. Large language models (LLMs) offer new potential for analyzing these reports, but often generate unreliable or hallucinated outputs when domain grounding is absent. This study introduces the Mixture-of-Retrieval Agentic RAG (MoRA-RAG), a knowledge-grounded LLM framework that transforms reconnaissance reports into a structured foundation for multi-hazard reasoning. The framework integrates a Mixture-of-Retrieval mechanism that dynamically routes queries across hazard-specific databases while using agentic chunking to preserve contextual coherence during retrieval. It also includes a verification loop that assesses evidence sufficiency, refines queries, and initiates targeted searches when information remains incomplete. We construct HazardRecQA by deriving question-answer pairs from GEER reconnaissance reports, which document 90 global events across seven major hazard types. MoRA-RAG achieves up to 94.5 percent accuracy, outperforming zero-shot LLMs by 30 percent and state-of-the-art RAG systems by 10 percent, while reducing hallucinations across diverse LLM architectures. MoRA-RAG also enables open-weight LLMs to achieve performance comparable to proprietary models. It establishes a new paradigm for transforming post-disaster documentation into actionable, trustworthy intelligence for hazard resilience.",针对灾后侦察报告非结构化且难以系统分析的问题，提出了 MoRA-RAG 框架。该知识增强型智能体 RAG 利用混合检索机制动态路由查询至特定灾害数据库，并采用智能分块保持上下文连贯。内置的验证循环可评估证据充分性并启动针对性搜索。在基于 GEER 报告构建的 HazardRecQA 数据集上，MoRA-RAG 准确率达 94.5%，优于零样本 LLM 30% 及 SOTA RAG 系统 10%，显著减少了幻觉，并使开源模型性能接近专有模型。
2511.14007,Can Artificial Intelligence Accelerate Technological Progress? Researchers' Perspectives on AI in Manufacturing and Materials Science,"Artificial intelligence (AI) raises expectations of substantial increases in rates of technological and scientific progress, but such anticipations are often not connected to detailed ground-level studies of AI use in innovation processes. Accordingly, it remains unclear how and to what extent AI can accelerate innovation. To help to fill this gap, we report results from 32 interviews with U.S.-based academic manufacturing and materials sciences researchers experienced with AI and machine learning (ML) techniques. Interviewees primarily used AI for modeling of materials and manufacturing processes, facilitating cheaper and more rapid search of design spaces for materials and manufacturing processes alike. They report benefits including cost, time, and computation savings in technology development. However, interviewees also report that AI/ML tools are unreliable outside design spaces for which dense data are already available; that they require skilled and judicious application in tandem with older research techniques; and that AI/ML tools may detrimentally circumvent opportunities for disruptive theoretical advancement. Based on these results, we suggest there is reason for optimism about acceleration in sustaining innovations through the use of to AI/ML; but that support for conventional empirical, computational, and theoretical research is required to maintain the likelihood of further major advances in manufacturing and materials science.",通过对 32 位美国制造与材料科学研究人员的采访，探讨了 AI 对技术进步的加速作用。结果表明，AI 主要用于建模及快速搜索设计空间，节省了成本和时间。然而，AI 工具在数据稀疏区域不可靠，需结合传统技术谨慎使用，且可能阻碍颠覆性理论发展。结论认为 AI 能加速持续性创新，但维持传统实证与理论研究仍是取得重大突破的关键。
